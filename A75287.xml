            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>OF many Books there is no end, and much ſtudy is a wearineſs to the fleſh:</hi> The Experience of this Truth (eſpecially in theſe latter days) hath ſometimes put me to ſad and ſerious thoughts, How ſhould a Chriſtian furniſh himſelf with a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Library, to help him on in his way Heaven-ward? Should he buy up all the Ancients, or (in caſe he want the Tongues) ſhould he buy up all our Modern Engliſh Writers, Poſitive and Polemical, they might fill his Cloſet, but he ſhould finde <hi>no end of buying,</hi> as there is <hi>no end of making Books:</hi> and if he reſolved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fell to reading he might conclude with the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>Much ſtudy is a wearineſs of the fleſh;</hi> nay, in in ſuch variety, he would finde the moſt of his ſtudy ſo impertinent, ſo unprofitable, that he might fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conclude, <hi>Such a ſtudy</hi> is a loſs to his Soul, and rather an hinderer, then an helper of it in the way to Heaven. To prevent this, ſome have adviſed Chriſtians to chooſe out, amongſt that world of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety we now enjoy, <hi>ſuch Authors as are moſt ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their Genius and Imployment.</hi> The Lord <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulam,</hi> with ſome others, give their opinions, That <hi>if the choyce and beſt Obſervations, which have been made diſperſedly in our Engliſh Sermons (leaving out the largeneſs of Exhortations and Applications thereupon) were ſet down in a Continuance, it would
<pb facs="tcp:117624:4"/> be the beſt work in Divinity that hath been written ſince the Apoſtles times.</hi> And Dr. <hi>Hackwith</hi> repeats almoſt the ſame words, ſaying, That <hi>the Sermons of this latter Age, ſpecially in this Land, have doubtleſs been more exquiſite and effectual, then ordinarily they have been in any precedent Age; inſomuch as it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that if there were a choyce Collection made of the moſt accurate ſince the entrance of Queen</hi> Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth <hi>to theſe preſent times (omiting the large Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations thereupon) it would prove one of the rareſt Pieces that hath been publiſhed ſince the Apostles times:</hi> Dr. <hi>Hackwiths</hi> Apology of the Power and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God in the Government of the World, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. Indeed, had we ſuch a Book ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, I would adviſe the Chriſtians of our Age to buy the Bible, and that Book, and to ſtudy them, and no more, as to their Spiritual good. But alas, this Book is rather wiſhed for, then hoped after; we may expect and wait for it till our eyes ſink in our heads, and be never the nearer. However, it was my deſign to have carried on ſuch a buſineſs as this in <hi>the main neceſſary things;</hi> not that I would read over all Authors on all ſubjects, but that I would firſt limit my ſelf to ſuch ſubjects, and then upon them cull out the beſt and choyce Obſervations of many godly and learned Authors. In this deſign I have pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed and obſerved theſe particulars:—</p>
            <p n="1">1. I have brought into method the <hi>Duties</hi> of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, which I call <hi>The Middle things,</hi> in reference to <hi>The Firſt and Laſt things,</hi> before Printed: The <hi>matter</hi> I have for the moſt part drawn from others, onely the <hi>method</hi> I have framed, as the Lord hath enabled; and wherein all Authors that ever I ſaw were ſilent, I have thereto added, to compleat the work for the <hi>matter</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:117624:4"/>2. I have purpoſely omitted the many Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, and tedious Diſputes of this Age: For my part, I ſee little edifying in them; nay, is not the fat and marrow of Chriſtian Religion loſt by them? Were I to adviſe againſt any Error, Hereſie, I had rather bid my Adverſaries read ſome Books of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, Practical Divinity, wherein Truth and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is laid out in its life and power, then all the volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous Controverſies that ever I could write, or ever have been writ by any other of the Sons of men. I deny not but theſe kinde of Books (the Spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring) may convince mens judgements; but the other ſort works both on judgement and Conſcience, on their heads and hearts: The Controverſial way of arguing, <hi>pro &amp; contra,</hi> I cannot but approve; but the way of the Spirit, in which he leads and convinceth the Soul irreſiſtably, I muſt needs prefer. Hence you ſee the reaſon of the <hi>method</hi> I have propounded; wherein I dare ſay (yet with a ſpirit of ſubmiſſion) the workings of the Spirit, the breathings of Chriſt, the pantings of a Soul after Chriſt, are more fully mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, then in all the jarring Pamphlets which this Age hath copiouſly afforded: My deſire is both to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and to reform; to inform the judgement, and to reform life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I have the rather fallen on this ſubject of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> both becauſe neceſſary in their way, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſo much oppoſed by many of our Age, who ſurely are not acquainted with them (with the workings of the Spirit in them, and by them) for otherwiſe it could not be ſo: If this Error ſpread, it will quickly eat out all Religion, and throw down Souls to Hell. Their pretence is, who are the Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of it, That they have found out a near and eaſie
<pb facs="tcp:117624:5"/> way to heaven;<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> in his Survey of Spiritual Antichriſt.</note> but I <hi>rather believe Christ</hi> (ſaith <hi>Rutherford) who tells us it is a way of many miles, ſtrait, narrow and thorny; indeed the Meritorious way to us is eaſie, but the way of a Christian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation (whether they will or no) lyeth through Duties;</hi>

            <p>IT is thy priviledge who readeſt, for Soul-help, to receive this Conſcientious Contexture, a teaching and exciting pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of choyce Piety, out of the hand of thy deareſt Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> who gave himſelf for thee, that he might give himſelf to thee; and with himſelf, that which doth convey himſelf, the <hi>Gifts, Graces, Evidences, Experiences, Improvements,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual actings</hi> of all thoſe that are partakers of the Root and Fatneſs of that <hi>Olive.</hi> Here is then a Love-token, thy loving Husband hath been preparing for thee weeks and moneths (it may be ſome years) by the Study, Pains, Prayers, Tears, the Soul and Body-travel of a tender-hearted Brother; be thou ready for a meeting of Loves, that at the receit, of this, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable fruit of love, Chriſt and thy Soul may rejoyce together. Is there not not a cauſe? doth he not rejoyce over thee with joy? doth he not reſt in his love? doth not he joy over thee with ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? let this Love-token ſpeak; herein thy free given Royalties are heaped up as high as <hi>Heaven, Juſtification, Reconciliation, Adoption, Sanctification, Glorification;</hi> Thy helpful <hi>Experiences</hi> remembred, and improved; thy heart-chearing <hi>Evidences</hi> col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and cleared; thy love-<hi>Duty</hi> diſcovered, and precious Directions given, for an advantagious performance of them, in Secret, in Family, in Publique, for the mutual overflowings of love betwixt Chriſt and thy Soul. Upon ſerious and ſad thoughts, that the godly generally of later times, have been taken up with wrangling Diſputes, and thereby taken off from Chriſtian affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and Communion (and I fear from Chriſt too in dangerous meaſure) It hath been amongſt my deſires, That God would ſtir up the hearts of ſome of his Servants, to call off his people from theſe Soul-hurting Contendings, unto the Reading, and Study of Soul-<hi>helping</hi> Treatiſes; aſſuring my ſelf, That if the people of God were helped againſt their contentious, and jarring Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, the differences in their heads would be more eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, as to dear love, and due Spiritual Communion. I could not but obſerve, when theſe Papers were brought to my view, that the forementioned deſires of my heart were imprinted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
<pb facs="tcp:117624:8"/> which made them more dear to me, and more willing to endear them to the ſincere-hearted, as a happy mean of helping hearts, healing differences, and preparing the Lords lot for thoſe better times, which are more look'd after, and boaſted of, then prepared for: In reference to theſe reſtoring and refreſhing times (though the workings of God have been very various, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly contrary, now ſetting forward, and then ſetting back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) God hath not been wanting to feed the laboring, and ſometimes almoſt fainting Faith of his people, by Divine argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; amongſt which, this is one, and not the leaſt, That whileſt Providence hath been at work to remove hinderances, and to open a full and free way amongſt men, the in-dwelling Spirit hath been as buſie in holy men, to ſtir up ſome to Pray, others to Preach, and others to Write, for the wide-opening of a door in men; the gracious inlarging of the heart, which gives aſſurance, that when God hath ſuffered them that are for no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to play a firſt game, and them that are for all Religions, to play a ſecond, that both the open and ſecret enemy of true Religion might be diſcovered, and diſcarded; he will then grant a longed for, joyful meeting of <hi>Holy</hi> times, and <hi>Holy</hi> hearts. To further the holineſs of the heart, which gives the leading to holy times, is the happy project of compiling and Printing this Book. That it may be ſanctified by the Spirit of Holineſs, unto ſo good and promiſing an end, let be thy Prayer, that the Pains and Prayers of the Author, may be turned into Comforts and Praiſes; which is the hope and prayer of him</p>

            <p>AMongst the multitude of Books in this Age, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlatively above our ability to buy or read, thoſe ſeem to me moſt worthy of thy choyce, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiouſly, in a methodical, plain and familiar way, ſet forth to us <hi>totum hominis,</hi> the whole duty of man, the ſervice of God in holineſs and righteouſneſs, the right uſe, and wiſe improvement of the means of Grace: Theſe being wells of Salvation to quench our thirſt, and breaſts of Conſolation, to ſtrengthen, revive, and comfort us in our Pilgrimage from Earth to Heaven: Voluminous Controverſies may clear the underſtanding, and help to deliver and preſerve that light from the poyſoning clouds of Heretical darkneſs; but they do not quicken us to duty, to the love, and life of Chriſt, to the hope of Glory; they do not increaſe, but rather weaken the power of godlineſs. Diligence in reading of tedious Diſputes, is not the way to poſſeſs that fatneſs and fulneſs of true life, peace and joy, which are treaſured up for us in the Meritorious ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of our Redee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In the reading of theſe with fervent Prayers, with ſerious and ſetled Meditations, many poor burthened ſinners have been raiſed up out of the depths of a wounding, condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conſcience, and brought to a transfigured Mountain, and Heaven on Earth in raviſhing Conſolations. Such a Diſcourſe is here preſented to thy view, by a Reverend and Religious Author, who hath experimentally learned, and
<pb facs="tcp:117624:9"/> doth daily copy out in his life the precious Truths of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, the Myſteries of Godlineſs. It is an high pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, and great advantage to the Souls welfare, to learn of thoſe, who have what they teach, not onely in their lips, but alſo in their hearts and lives; who are able to ſay, <hi>In theſe ways we have found reſt; as ye have heard or ſeen us do, ſo do ye.</hi> When the Converſation of Paſtors preacheth Chriſt and Heaven, as well as their Doctrine; when vocal, real, and experimental Sermons go together, that's likely to be a ſucceſsful Preaching. This Treatiſe may well be called, The Marrow of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, A good and perfect guide to the <hi>New-Jeruſalem,</hi> A golden Conduit-pipe, to convey to us ſtreams of life from the Fountain of Living-waters, or the godly mans <hi>Vade mecum,</hi> wherein is compendiouſly, yet fully deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Rule and Life of the new Creature.

                  <p>THe firſt Priviledge which immediately follows our <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Chriſt,</hi> is <hi>Juſtification;</hi> which conſiſts in theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, and Remiſſion of ſin.</p>
                  <p>To prevent erroneous miſconceits, which ſpring from the confounding of things that differ, underſtand, That a man may be ſaid to be juſtified either intentionally, or virtually, or actually;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:117624:14"/> either in God, or in Chriſt, or in himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Intentionally in God <hi>(i.)</hi> in Gods Purpoſe and Decree: This is from all eternity, but this Decree and Intention doth not put any thing into a ſtate of actual being, but in the fulneſs of time.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Virtually in Chriſt: And this is from the day of Chriſts Paſſion, and in the vertue of his Satisfaction; yet this intendeth no more, but that Satisfaction is made, and Remiſſion purchaſed by the Blood of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Actually in himſelf: When a man hath the poſſeſſion of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> immediately after his <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Now this <hi>Juſtification</hi> conſidered as it is <hi>a ſtate of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor,</hi> a Covenant ſtate with God, which a man at his firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving is put into, is not reiterated, no more then a wife, after that firſt entrance into the relation, is frequently made a wife; yet the particular acts of Pardon, and Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, are continually by God communicated unto the Believer. In this reſpect this <hi>actual Juſtification</hi> (or particular acts of pardon) hath its degrees of progreſſion: The beginning thereof is laid in our firſt Union and Incorporation into Chriſt; the conſummation of it is not till the Judge at the latter day hath ſolemnly pronounced the Sentence of final Abſolution, and ſo ſet us in full poſſeſſion of entire Remiſſion: Between both theſe, there is a progreſſive work of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> by the conſtant actings of the Spirit, applying the blood of Chriſt by the hand of Faith, to the quiet and comfort of the ſoul: The firſt we may term initial <hi>Juſtification,</hi> the ſecond progreſſive, the laſt perfective; the ſecond is the fruit of the firſt, and the preludial aſſurance of the laſt: The firſt is wrought and ſealed in the firſt Sacrament, the ſecond is wrought and ſealed in the ſecond Sacrament; and both theſe branches of Sacramental <hi>Juſtification,</hi> are to us the preaſſurance of that complemental and perfective <hi>Juſtification,</hi> the ſentence whereof putteth an end to all fears, changing our Faith and Hope into fruition and full poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>It hath been commonly ſaid by ſome of our beſt Divines, That Juſtification is tranſacted in our firſt Union and Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration into Chriſt; at which time it is conceived, That the pardon of <hi>all ſin</hi> is ſealed to the Believer at once. But I fear the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117624:14"/> of this point (not untrue in it ſelf, if not miſtaken and miſapprehended) hath laid the ground upon which ſome build that unhappy Structure which <hi>turneth the grace of God into wantonneſs:</hi> who knoweth not that <hi>Juſtification</hi> in the proper acceptation of thew ord, according to the Scripture phraſe, is <hi>the act of a Judge pronouncing a judicial ſentence, wherein he abſolveth the perſon of the ſinner from all ſin and puniſhment due to him for ſin, and that for the alone Righteouſneſs of the ſurety Chriſt freely imputed, and by Faith received of him.</hi> And according to this, I ſuppoſe we ſhall not erre from the truth, if we ſay, 1. That the main work of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> is even as yet to us future, <hi>viz.</hi> at the great and laſt day of Judgement, when we ſhall receive a final <hi>Quietus eſt,</hi> and diſcharge, and when God ſhall wipe away all tears from our eyes: And yet 2. That in our firſt Union with Chriſt there is a work of <hi>Juſtification, viz.</hi> actual Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, and actual Remiſſion of what ſin for the preſent the ſoul ſtands guilty of, at that time when it is firſt united to Chriſt. I dare not ſay that <hi>Justification, quatenus</hi> it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends Imputation, and Remiſſion of ſin, is one individual act; or that all ſins, paſt, preſent, and to come, are remitted to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever at once; but this I ſay, That in our firſt Union, all our ſins paſt and preſent, are actually pardoned; and this favor recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is a pledge of aſſurance, That in future alſo, by applying our ſelves to Chriſt, we may and ſhall receive the forgiveneſs of our daily ſins, and that at the laſt day we ſhall at once be abſolved from all Accuſations and Charges laid in againſt us; and that <hi>Juſtification</hi> (beſides thoſe particular acts of pardon, and Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs) doth connote a ſtate that the ſubject at his firſt believing is put into, <hi>viz. A ſtate of grace, and favor, and reconciliation with God for the imputed Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Christ, without Apostacy from it, either total or final.</hi>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117624:16"/> being imputed, and ſins pardoned, we have peace with God; not onely peace from God in our Conſciences, but peace with God in our reconcilement to him, and in his favor towards us; in our Imputation and Pardon the Lord accounts us juſt, in our Reconciliation the Lord accounts us friends: Indeed our meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Reconciliation is by Chriſts death; as the Kings Son, who procures his Fathers favor towards a Malefactor, who yet lies in cold Irons, and knows it not; and this is before actual pardon, or actual being: But actual and efficacious Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby we come to the fruition and poſſeſſion of it, is (to my weak conception) after pardon of ſin. Now this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation conſiſts in two things: 1. In our peace with God, whereby the Lord lays by all acts of hoſtility againſt us. 2. In the love and favor of God: he now loves us not onely with a love of good will, as in our Election, but with a love of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency and delight. O conſider what a bleſſed ſtate is this!</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That God ſhould be pacified with us after anger, after provocation by ſin, after ſuch wrath, which like fire hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed thouſand thouſands, and burnt down to the bottom of Hell, and is now, and ever ſhall be burning upon them in Hell.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That God ſhould be pacified wholly and throughly, that there ſhould be no conſuming fury left for us to feel: <hi>Fury is not in me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 27 4.</note> ſaith God; indeed bryars and thorns <hi>(i.)</hi> obſtinate ſinners, that prick and cut him to the very heart by their impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency, <hi>he will</hi> burn them together: God out of Chriſt <hi>is a conſuming fire,</hi>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117624:16"/> more, the abounding of our ſin,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.20.</note> is now the occaſion of the abounding of his grace; our very wants and miſeries, are the very objects and occaſions of his bowels and tender mercies: O what a Priviledge is this! Did the Lord ever ſhew mercy to the Angels that ſinned? Did not one ſin caſt them out of favor utterly? and yet that ſo many thouſand thouſand of ſins ſhould guſh out of my heart, and thy heart that readeſt, againſt the mercy, love and kindeneſs of our good God, and for all this he not be incenſed; that the Lord who poured out all his anger upon his own Son for us, cannot now pour out, nay hath not one drop left (though he would) to pour out upon us for any one of our ſins! Stand amazed ye Angels, and all the Hoſt of Heaven at this!</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That the Lord ſhould be thus pacified with enemies: A man may be eaſily pacified with one that offends him but a little, but with an enemy that ſtrikes at his life (as by every ſin we do at the living God) what can we ſay to this?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That he ſhould be pacified by ſuch a wonderful way as the blood of Jeſus Chriſt: This is ſuch a love, as one would think the infinite wiſdom of a bleſſed God could have deviſed no greater: It is enough to burſt the heart with aſtoniſhment and amazement, to think that the party offended (who therefore had no cauſe to ſeek peace with us again) ſhould finde out ſuch a way of peace as this: Wo to the world that deſpiſe this peace.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That being thus pacified, we may come into Gods preſence with boldneſs at any time, and ask what we will; I wonder what he can deny us, if he love us:<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 5.14.</note> 
                     <hi>This is the confidence that we have in him, That if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us.</hi>

                     <hi>and the beaſts of the field ſhall be at peace with thee:</hi> As when the Captain of the Army is pacified, none of the Soldiers muſt hurt or ſtrike that man; ſo no Creature muſt hurt us, nay all the Creatures that ſeem our enemies, ſhall be forced to do us good: <hi>O Death,</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. Hence when we are in Chriſt his Son, he loves us with the ſame love as he doth his Son.</p>

                     <hi>according to the good pleaſure of his will.</hi> O the excellency of this Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge! It appears in theſe reſpects:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Lord ſhould prize us as his Sons: A man that hath Sons, eſteems them more then all his goods and Servants; ſo the Lord eſteems of the pooreſt, unworthieſt Believer, more then of all his houſhold-ſtuff, more then of Heaven, Earth, and all the glory of it, more then of all the Kings and great men in the world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the Lord ſhould take care for us as for Sons: In times of want we are ready to queſtion, <hi>What we ſhall eat or drink? how we ſhall live?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 6.31.</note> O conſider, are we the Sons of God? then he that <hi>feeds the Ravens, and clothes the Lillies,</hi> will provide for us; or ſuppoſe we continue in the want of temporal things,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:117624:17"/> why the Lord is therein plotting our eternal good: <hi>No chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the preſent ſeemeth joyous, but grievous; nevertheleſs, afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteouſneſs,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the Lord ſhould love us as his Sons: Sometimes we think that the Lord loves us not, becauſe we do not feel his love, or know his love; but do not we love our Sons, becauſe whiles they are yong, they know not their Fathers, or becauſe their Fathers are ſometimes out of ſight, and have not them always in their arms? <hi>Zion ſaid, The Lord hath forſaken me,</hi>

                  <p>THe fourth Priviledge is <hi>Sanctification,</hi> which in order of nature follows <hi>Adoption:</hi> No ſooner are we Sons, but we receive the image of our heavenly Father in <hi>Sanctification;</hi> The maner of it is thus:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Spirit works in us a Principle of Spiritual life: The Scripture ſometimes calls it a <hi>Seed,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Ioh 3.9. Ioh 4.14. 2 Cor. 4.10, 11</note> ſometimes a <hi>Spring,</hi> or <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> ſometimes <hi>The life of Chriſt,</hi> becauſe it is conveyed unto us by the Spirit of Chriſt, by means of our inſeparable union with Chriſt. What name ſoever we give it, we may not conceive it to be a new faculty added unto thoſe which are in men by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but an improvement of thoſe abilities to work Spiritually, as they did naturally before Regeneration: Hence it is that a regenerate man in Scripture is ſaid <hi>To walk after the Spirit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom 8.1. Gal. 5.18. Gal 5.25.</note> — <hi>To be led by the Spirit, — To walk in the Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. From this Fountain ſprings all thoſe habits of Spiritual grace, which are ſeverally diſtinguiſhed by the names of <hi>Faith, Hope, Love,</hi> &amp;c. although to ſpeak properly, they are but the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſifications of that Spiritual Principle within us, diſtinguiſhed by theſe names.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From theſe habits of grace abiding in us, ordinarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds Spiritual motions and operations according to thoſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits. And as it is with Natural habits, ſo it is with Spiritual, they are much increaſed and ſtrengthned by their motions, opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>(i.)</hi> by the uſe and exerciſe of them, and are as much weakned by diſuſe, and neglect of ſuch an exerciſe. I deny not but for all this, there is within us a woful, ſinful nature, croſs,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:117624:18"/> and contrary unto holineſs, and leading us daily into Captivity: yet here's our Priviledge, even <hi>Sanctification in part;</hi> ſurely the Lord hath given us another Nature, a new Nature: there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe within us, which makes us wreſtle againſt ſin, and ſhall in time prevail over all ſin: <hi>A bruiſed reed ſhall he not break,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The excellency of this Priviledge appears in theſe particulars:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This is our glory, and beauty, even Glorification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun: What greater glory then to be like unto God? <hi>We are changed into the ſame image, from glory to glory;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.18.</note> every degree of grace is glory, and the perfection of glory in heaven, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts chiefly in the perfection of grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This will give us abundance of ſweet peace: For whence comes troubles, and doubts of Gods favor and love? Is it not ſome guile or decay here? Is it not ſome boldneſs to ſin? Is it not our ſecret dalliance with ſome known ſin, continued in with ſecret impenitency? On the other ſide, what was <hi>Pauls</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing? <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> peace? the one cryed, that <hi>In all ſincerity and ſimplicity he had his converſation amongst men;</hi> the other,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.12.

                     <hi>Lord remember, I have walked before thee uprightly:</hi> not that this was the ground of their peace, for that onely is Free-grace in Chriſt, but the means of their peace: That is a curſed peace, that is kept by looking to Chriſt, and yet loving our luſts.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This will make us fit for <hi>Gods uſe:</hi> A filthy unclean veſſel is good for nothing, till cleanſed; a man muſt firſt purge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and then he ſhall be <hi>a veſſel unto honor, ſanctified, and meet for the maſters uſe, and prepared unto every good work.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. By this we have a moſt ſweet and comfortable <hi>evidence</hi> of our <hi>Juſtification:</hi> Nor is this a running upon the Covenant of Works; Is not <hi>Sanctification (the writing of the Law in our hearts)</hi> a priviledge of the Covenant of Grace, as well as <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification?</hi> and can the evidencing of one Priviledge by another, be a running upon the Covenant of Works?

                     <p>NOw the maner (O my ſoul) how Chriſt heals our <hi>Duties,</hi> it is thus:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He takes our perſons, and carries them in to God the Father, in a moſt unperceivable way to us; he knows, that if our perſons be not firſt accepted, our <hi>Duties</hi> cannot be accepted: <hi>Love me, and love my Duty; hate me, and hate my Duty.</hi> It is true, that in the Covenant of Works, God firſt accepted of the work, and then of the perſon; but in the Covenant of Grace, God firſt accepts of the perſon, and then of the work: Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that our works (our <hi>Duties</hi>) may be accepted, Chriſt Ieſus our great High Prieſt firſt takes our perſons, and carries them into the preſence of God the Father: This was plainly ſhadowed out to us, by that of the High Prieſt,<note place="margin">Exod. 28 29.</note> who <hi>went into the holy of holieſt, with the Names of all the Tribes upon his breaſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. As Chriſt takes our perſons, and carries them in to God the Father; ſo when we perform <hi>Duty,</hi> he obſerves what evil or failing there is in that <hi>Duty,</hi> and draws it out, before he preſents it to God the Father: As a childe that would preſent his father with a Poſie, he goes into the garden, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers flowers and weed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thus we go to <hi>Duty,</hi> and we gather weeds and flowers together, but Chriſt comes, and picks out the weeds, and ſo preſents nothing but flowers to God the Father: <hi>Who may abide the day of his coming</hi> (ſaid the Prophet of Chriſt) <hi>and who ſhall ſtand when he appeareth?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mal. 3.2, 3, 4.</note> 
                        <hi>for he is like a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finers fire, and like fullers ſope: And he ſhall ſit as a refiner and purifier of ſilver, and ſhall purifie the ſons of Levi, and purge them as gold and ſilver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteouſneſs; then ſhall the offerings of Judah and Jeruſalem be pleaſant unto the Lord:</hi> mark, <hi>Thou ſhall their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings be pleaſant:</hi> then? when? <hi>When he had purged their ſacrifices and their offerings.</hi> Thus it was in the days of his fleſh, and much more now.</p>
                     <p n="3">3.

Is there no Hell hot enough to torment? Are there no Plagues to confound him? Yes: Why ſins he then? Oh! he prays to God for forgiveneſs; he ſorrows, and repents in ſecret (as he ſaith) and this bears him out in his lewd prancks.

Why is he not more humbled under his ſins? The Reaſon is, he conſtantly obſerves Evening and Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prayer, and then he craves forgiveneſs for his failings, by which courſe he hopes to make his peace with God: And hence he ſinneth without fear, and riſeth out of his fall into ſin without ſorrow; he maintains his ſins by his <hi>Duties.</hi>

                  <p n="8">8. That the Lord Chriſt may be exalted, and advanced by <hi>Duties.</hi> The main end of <hi>Duties,</hi> is the glory of him who hath Redeemed us with the price of his blood, and by the power

Now this is the main end of right obedience, That <hi>the Crown may be ſet on Chriſts head,</hi> that he who is King of Saints, may have the honor given him, due to his Kingly Office. In this reſpect, I cannot blame them who blame others, for cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, and magnifying mans works in their own name. To ſay that Chriſt is always ſuppoſed as principal,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> in Phil. 3.8.</note> is no ſufficient Apology: For why onely ſuppoſed? why not he named, as well as <hi>Duties,</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs?</hi> Certainly, it is not good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners (to ſay no worſe) to forget him, whiles his poor Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſo highly remembred. When Servants bring Preſents from their Maſters to any, they do not ſay, I beſtow ſuch and ſuch a thing on you, but, My Maſter ſends it you; if he ſhould take it on himſelf, he ſhould go for an arrogant fellow: nor will it ſalve the matter, when he is taxed for ſuch arrogancy, to ſay, My Maſter ſhould have been ſuppoſed, when he gave no hint of him. <hi>Me think it were comely</hi> (ſaith the Author rightly in this) <hi>in extolling of Mans Righteouſneſs, explicitely to aſcribe all the praiſe to the glory of Chriſt,</hi>

By giving a principle of Spiritual life, habitual grace, a renewed frame of heart. 2. By exciting and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this grace: and both theſe are ever afforded to the Saints, onely the latter is more or leſs, according to his pleaſure: So that in the worſt times, a Believer hath power to do good, though not alike at all times; and this power we muſt uſe, and put forth our ſelves as we are able, or we cannot with reaſon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his help.

                  <p n="1">1. Let us take matter and motives to humble our ſouls under the ſight and ſence of this inherent pollution. And to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, conſider we the rueful complaints of the holieſt Saints againſt it:<note place="margin">Rom. 7.24.</note> 
                     <hi>O wretched man that I am</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) who ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me from the body of this death? Behold, I was ſhapen in iniquity</hi> (ſaid <hi>David) and in ſin did my mother conceive me:</hi>

Let us pray againſt it, that <hi>though it be in us, yet it may not hurt us,</hi> nor be imputed to us; That God would give us his Spirit to bridle our corruption, and eſpecially that he would give us the Spirit of Sanctification, that he would cleanſe us from this filth more and more, that he would ſeaſon the fountain, and at laſt dry it up.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let us ſtrive after contrary holineſs, and endeavor the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of our natures and lives: <hi>Put we off the old man,</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. Avoid we all occaſions of evil: Be afraid, not onely of the fire and flame, but of the very ſmoke of ſin; it is dangerous to approach near the Whirl-pit, or to <hi>play about the hole of the Asp, or the den of the Cockatrice;</hi> and therefore prayed <hi>David, Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſa. 119.37.</note> not my <hi>heart</hi> onely from affecting it, but mine <hi>eyes</hi> alſo from beholding it: <hi>There is a ſhutting of the eyes from beholding evil,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Reſiſt we the temptations of ſin: It may be (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all our care) temptations will offer themſelves, and urge us to evil, but then we muſt conſtantly reſiſt, and this is praiſe worthy: If a man keep himſelf ſober, when he cannot come to wine or ſtrong drink, it is nothing; but for a man to be careful not to break the bounds of ſobriety, when he ſhall be in place where wine is plenty, and no reſtraint of it, and where company will be urging him to take more then is meet, this is true temperance indeed: If a man live chaſtely when he wants his lewd company, it is nothing; but for a <hi>Joſeph</hi> (ſued and ſought to by his Miſtris, yea, urged and ſolicited day after day to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to her adulterous deſires) to refuſe then, and to chooſe rather loſs of preſent liberty by not ſinning,<note place="margin">

Prov. 8.13.</note> then to gain further preferment by conſenting to ſin, this is true chaſtity indeed. Away then with thoſe idle apologies, <hi>I was urged to ſin, I was provoked to lewdneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Neither man nor Devil can compel you to ſin, unleſs you will your own ſelf: * <hi>The Devil may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade, intice, ſuggeſt, and provoke, but he cannot inforce nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain;</hi> nor (unleſs your own hearts give conſent) can he cauſe you to ſin.</p>

                     <hi>to abhor it,</hi> Rom. 12.9.<note place="margin">Rom. 12.9.</note> as the meat that ſometimes we have ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feted of, our ſtomack nouriſheth and goeth againſt it; ſo ſhould our hearts riſe againſt ſin: And to this purpoſe conſider we 1. The foulneſs of ſin; it is fouler then the fouleſt Fiend in hell. 2. The illneſs of ſin; it is a greater ill then the damnation of a mans ſoul, or then the deſtruction of all the creatures in the world. 3. The infectiouſneſs of ſin; it is of that peſtilential property, that it pollutes every thing it comes near. 4.

                     <hi>SECT. 5.</hi> Of the maner of Watchfulneſs over ſpecial ſins.</head>
                  <p>THat we may watch over our ſpecial ſins, our <hi>Dalilah</hi> ſins, our darling-delights, obſerve we theſe Rules:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Endeavor we the mortifying of this ſin: Some one ſin there is in every ſoul of us that is moſt predominant. Now it is the main work of a Chriſtian, as to fall out for ever with all ſin, ſo eſpecially to improve all his Spiritual forces and ayd from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, utterly to demoliſh, and to beat down to the ground this hold, this boſom-ſin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Lay we load of deepeſt groans, and ſtrongeſt cryes for
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:117624:35"/> mortifying grace againſt this dominiering ſin; eſpecially every Morning and Evening ſtrive with God in our Prayers for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable conqueſt over it, inforce and inlarge that paſſage with an extraordinary pang of fervency, cry we mightily to God for power and ſtrength againſt this luſt, that continually wars againſt the ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Bend we our ſelves againſt the ſpecial acts, occaſions, and opportunities of this ſin; as ſuppoſe <hi>raſh anger,</hi> the ſin which a man ſifteth, and purſueth to the extirpation of it; in this caſe, he ſhould reſolve with himſelf, not to ſpeak harſhly, nor to look fiercely, nor to uſe any churliſh behavior, whether his Servant diſpleaſe him with negligence, or his Friend offend him with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs, or his enemy provoke him with ill language, or ſome malicious dealing.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As oft as we finde any motion of this ſin to ſtir, and ſhew it ſelf in us, it will be convenient, not onely to with-hold our conſent, but withal to exerciſe ſome act of contrary holineſs: As ſuppoſe <hi>Deſire of revenge</hi> be the ſin, which ſtirreth up our blood, and boileth within us, we muſt not onely forbear to avenge our ſelves, but alſo bend our ſelves to pray for him that hath offended us; and if <hi>he hunger, to feed him,</hi> if <hi>he thirſt, to give him drink.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Settle we in our ſelves a purpoſe of heart to forbear it for time to come: In undertaking of which purpoſe, it will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to ſet our ſelves ſome ſhort ſpace of time, in which we may force our ſelves to the forbearance of it, as for a day, or a moneth, or the like; and when the prefixed time is come, we ſhould then queſtion our ſelves, How well we have performed? or how, or wherein we have failed? and then begin a new pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and preſcribe our ſelves a like time, for ſhunning of the ſame ſin; and ſo on from time to time, till we have gotten a full victory.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If in our daily or monethly review, we finde that we have been defective in performing of what we had purpoſed, then with an holy revenge we ſhould correct our former errors, beg pardon for our defects, and puniſh our ſelves for ſuch ſlothful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or wilfulneſs, by abſtinence from meat, eaſe, recreation; <hi>Keeping under our bodies,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.27.</note> 
                     <hi>and bringing them into ſubjection,</hi> by mulct, or forfeiture of ſome portion to the poor, whereby we

                  <p n="7">7. Above all, without which all the reſt are as nothing, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Promiſes of pardon in the blood of Chriſt:</hi> It is Faith in the Promiſes which will be able to cleanſe, and purge the heart from this ſin;<note place="margin">Heb. 9 13, 14.</note> 
                     <hi>If the blood of Bulls and of Goats</hi> (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) <hi>and the aſhes of an Heifer, sprinkling the unclean, ſanctifieth to the purifying of the fleſh; how much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who through the eternal Spirit offered himſelf without spot to God, purge your Conſciences from dead works, to ſerve the living God?</hi> the ſence is, When a man hath once applyed the blood of Chriſt for his Juſtification, this effect will follow it, That there will accompany it a certain vigour, vertue, power, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>rength, which will alſo purge his conſcience from dead works; there will go a power of the Spirit together with this blood, that ſhall not onely forbid him, and ſhew him that he ought not to do ſuch and ſuch evil things, but it ſhall cleanſe his conſcience from thoſe roots of dead works, thoſe corrupt luſts, and ſinful affections that are in him, and that diſpoſe him to that evil: Now this power is gotten by applying <hi>the blood (i.)</hi> by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the Promiſe of pardon and forgiveneſs by the <hi>blood of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Let no man think by his own ſtrength to prevail againſt any luſt; it is not our endeavoring, praying, bending our ſelves againſt the ſpecial acts and occaſions, exerciſing ſome acts of contrary holineſs, purpoſing to forbear it, puniſhing our ſelves for it (if gone about by our own might, and power, and ſtrength) will ever kill this ſin; no, no, we muſt do all theſe at the feet of Chriſt, and draw vertue from Chriſt; we muſt <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Promiſes,</hi> get aſſurance of pardon, get aſſurance of Gods love to us in Chriſt; we muſt labor to delight in God, to get communion with Chriſt, and then our hearts will grow to an application of the Commandment; and whereas before they reſiſted it, rebelled againſt it, they will then cleave to it, and love it, and delight in it, and receive an impreſſion from it. This I take it is the meaning of that Text,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.4.</note> 
                     <hi>Whereby are given to us exceeding great and precious promiſes, that by theſe we might be partakers of the divine nature, having eſcaped the corruption that is in the world through luſt; q.d.</hi> by believing the Promiſes we are made partakers of the godly nature, and we overcome our
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:117624:36"/> corruptions and luſts: Conſonant to which, is that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.3.</note> 
                     <hi>Know ye not, that as many as are baptized into Chriſt, are baptized into his death? q.d.</hi> as many as are baptized into Chriſt, for reconciliation with God, muſt needs be baptized into his death; they muſt be dead to ſin, as he was dead: We cannot be baptized into him for Reconciliation or Juſtification, but we muſt be baptized likewiſe for Mortification of the fleſh, and for Reſurrection to newneſs of life. To winde up all in a word, He that hath the ſtrongeſt Faith, that believes in the greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, the <hi>Promiſes of pardon and remiſſion,</hi> he hath the holieſt heart, the moſt mortified life: Sanctification and Mortification ariſe from that root of <hi>Juſtification.</hi> The blood of Chriſt hath not onely a power to waſh us from the guilt of ſin, but alſo to cleanſe us, and purge us from the power and ſtain of ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And therefore I ſay, the beſt way to get a great degree of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the beſt way to get a greater meaſure of the graces of the Spirit, the beſt way to mortifie our ſinful luſts, the beſt way to watch over our ſpecial ſins, is to labor to grow in Faith, in the <hi>belief of thoſe Promiſes of the Goſpel of Chriſt;</hi> and this would be well obſerved by thoſe that are a little legally byaſſed, or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to mortifie ſin onely by Vows, Promiſes, ſhunning occaſions, removing temptations, ſtrictneſs and ſeverity in Duties, fear of Hell and Judgements, ſcarce riſing ſo high for their Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as Chriſt.

                  <p>THat we may <hi>watch</hi> over our <hi>hearts,</hi> obſerve we theſe dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Guard we the windows of our ſoul, the Senſes: <hi>I made a Covenant with mine eyes</hi> (ſaid <hi>Job) why then ſhould I think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a maid?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iob 31.1. Pſal. 119.37.</note> 
                     <hi>Turn mine eyes from beholding vanities</hi> (ſaid <hi>David) and quicken thou me in thy way.</hi> It is incredible, what a deal of pollution and ill the Devil conveys inſenſibly into the heart, through theſe floodgates of ſin, and therefore we had need to watch over the Senſes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Go we down into our hearts, and conſider well all our thoughts; theſe, if good, will bring forth good fruit; and if evil, they are the parents and begetters of all ſins, the firſt plotters and contrivers of all Treaſons and Rebellions of our life, the bellows and incendiaries of all inordinate affections, the Panders to all other luſts, that <hi>take thought to provide for the ſatisfying of them,</hi> the diſturbers in all good Duties, that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and ſoil, and fly-blow all our Prayers, that they ſtink in the noſtrils of God; and therefore conſider and weigh well all our <hi>thoughts,</hi> for as our <hi>thoughts</hi> are, ſo be our affections, prayers, ſpeeches, actions.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let us make Conſcience of our thoughts: By them eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially do we ſanctifie, or ſin againſt God; by them eſpecially do we evidence our ſelves, to be ſincere-hearted Chriſtians, or diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling hypycrites; by them eſpecially will the Lord judge us at the laſt day, <hi>when he will make manifeſt the counſels of our hearts;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor 4.5.</note> by them eſpecially (if we will not make Conſcience of them) will God laſh us in Hell to all eternity, even by <hi>thoughts accuſing;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 33.8,</note> there ſhalt thou meditate terrors, and ſtudy Gods wrath, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with thy own ſins and miſeries, for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Reſiſt and cruſh we every exorbitant thought which draws to ſin, at the very firſt riſing: Is the temptation ſtrong? en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter it with this dreadful <hi>Dilemma, If I commit this ſin, either I muſt repent, or not repent; if I repent, it will coſt me more heart-break and spiritual ſmart, before I can purchaſe aſſurance of pardon and peace of Conſcience, then the ſenſual pleaſure can
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:117624:37"/> be worth; if I never repent, it will be the death and damnation of my ſoul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Lodge we not ſo much as light thoughts, unprofitable or vain thoughts in our hearts; they will ſtill be entring in, whileſt we are in theſe houſes of clay, yet lodge they muſt not. Hence the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.26.</note> 
                     <hi>Let not the Sun go down upon your wrath; q. d.</hi> if thoughts of anger come in, in the morning or day time, they muſt be turned out ere night; or if idle thoughts offer to come to bed to thee, let them not lodge with thee. I deny not but many good thoughts and motions may paſs, as ſtrangers through a bad mans heart, and multitudes of vain thoughts and motions may make a through-fare of a Believers heart, and diſturb him in good <hi>Duties,</hi> by knockings, and interruptions, and breakings in upon his heart, but ſtill they <hi>lodge</hi> not there, they are not there foſtered and harbored.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Forget and ſtifle we all thoughts of ſinful actions already paſſed: The minde is very apt to run over the paſſages and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the ſame ſins, long ſince committed, with a new and freſh delight; this argues wickedneſs of heart, and ſuch as when it is ordinary with the heart to do ſo, is not compatible with grace:<note place="margin">Rom. 6.12.</note> 
                     <hi>What fruit had you of thoſe things whereof ye are now aſhamed?</hi> All that the Saints reap out of ſuch fruits, is ſhame and ſorrow, and many a ſad ſigh: <hi>When Ephraim remembred his ſins, he was aſhamed and repented;</hi> a truly ſanctified ſoul will hate the appearance of his former ſins, and will have his heart inflamed with a zeal and revenge againſt it. What, do you repeat to your ſelves your old ſins with delight? this provokes God exceedingly, you thereby ſtand to, and make good your former act; you ſhew a delight to rake in thoſe wounds you have given Chriſt already, and therefore in hell it will prove the greateſt gall, to remember your old ſins; every circumſtance in every ſin then, will be as a dagger in your hearts. O ſtudy not theſe thoughts, forget them, ſtifle them!</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Entertain all good motions put into your heart by the bleſſed Spirit, howſoever occaſioned; whether by the Miniſtery of the Word, mindefulneſs of Death, Chriſtian admonition, reading ſome good Book, ſome ſpecial Croſs, or extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Mercy; feed, enlarge, and improve them to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, ſo ſhall we preſerve our hearts in a ſoft, comfortable
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:117624:37"/> temper, and heaven-ward, which is a ſingular happineſs.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Endeavor we to preſerve and keep up lively, holy, and Spiritual affections, and ſuffer them not to cool; or if we have grown remiſs, endeavor to recover thoſe affections again: Thoughts and affections are mutual cauſes of each other; <hi>Whileſt I muſed, the fire burned,</hi> ſaid <hi>David:</hi> and again,<note place="margin">Pſal. 39.3.</note> 
                     <hi>How love I thy Law? It is my meditation day and night.</hi> Firſt,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119 97.</note> his thoughts were the bellows that kindled and inflamed his affections: And ſecondly, his <hi>affections inflamed,</hi> made his thoughts to boyl, and to <hi>meditate on Gods Law day and night.</hi> Hence it is that men newly converted to God, having new and ſtrong affections, can with more pleaſure think of God then any elſe can.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Let us captivate and conform all the thoughts and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of our heart, to the Rules and Soveraignty of grace; <hi>Bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10 5.</note> If thy change in words, actions, and all outward carriages were An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical, yet if thy thoughts be ſinful and unſanctified, thou art a limb of Satan ſtill: Purity in the inward parts, is the moſt ſound evidence of our portion in the purity and power of Chriſt. <hi>O Jeruſalem, waſh thine heart from wickedneſs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ier. 4.14.</note> 
                     <hi>that thou mayeſt be ſaved: How long ſhall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee? God ſeeth</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>and underſtandeth our thoughts afar off:</hi> And hence it is that many humble ſouls,<note place="margin">Pſal. 139.2.</note> ſenſible of their ſecret ſins, in the preſence of Gods pure eye, are more grieved (ſetting aſide ill example and ſcandals) for the rebelliouſneſs of their thoughts, then the exorbitancy of their actions, for of theſe the world ſees the worſt; but concerning the other, it cuts them to the heart, that they are not ſo well able to preſerve their inward parts in purity, towards the all ſearching eye of God, as their words and actions in <hi>plauſibleneſs</hi> towards man.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Get we our hearts poſſeſt with deep, ſtrong, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful apprehenſions and impreſſions of Gods Holineſs, Majeſty, Omnipreſence, and Omniſcience: If any thoughts be of power to ſettle, fix, and draw in the minde of man, they are thoughts of him. What is the reaſon that Saints and Angels in Heaven have not a vain thought to eternity, but that their eye is never off him? we finde it by experience, a bleſſed means to avoid diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in Prayers, to inlarge a mans thoughts in his preparations before, or at the beginning, if with a conſideration of Gods
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:117624:38"/> Attributes and Relations to us, he ſets on the Duty.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Let us elevate, and often lift up our hearts towards hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: Conſider the bliſsful depths of Gods boundleſs Mercies in Chriſt; Conſider the glory, the everlaſtingneſs, the unutterable excellencies of that immortal ſhining Crown above, which after this life (and this life is but a bubble, a ſmoke, a ſhadow, a thought) ſhall be ſet on our heads by the hand of God; a very glimpſe whereof is able to ſweeten the bittereſt griefs that can be, and to diſpel thoſe miſts of fading vanities, which the world (heated by the fire of inordinate luſts) is wont to evaporate, and interpoſe betwixt the ſight of mens ſouls, and the bliſs of heaven.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Let us ſpend ſome thoughts, yea many thoughts, about the ſaving excellencies of Jeſus Chriſt: Conſider the wonder of our Redemption, the moſt admirable, and moſt aſtoniſhing plot of the bleſſed Trinity, ſitting in Councel about the ſaving of our ſouls; a Myſtery which the Angels ſtoop down to pry into, an Orient Pearl, that will out-ſhine all the ſparkling Jewels of the whole Creation; Conſider the Love-letters of Chriſt in his glorious Goſpel; the Love-tokens he hath ſent to our dear ſouls: And ah! what flames of divine affection? what raptures of zeal? what raviſhments of delights? what briniſh ſorrows, and great indignation againſt ſin? what extaſies of obedience can be enough for our bleſſed Lord, and deareſt Redeemer?</p>

                  <p n="1">1. With his Spiritual wiſdom; it is that muſt ſuggeſt to him, when, and how to reprove, whether preſently upon it, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times afterwards; whether directly and downright, or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and by intimation; whether perſonally, or in the general; whether in a fair and milder maner, or with a more bold and reſolute ſpirit; whether onely by diſcountenance, or by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. With his heart: A reproof muſt not ſpring from any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious humor, of cenſuring, and medling with his brethren; from any ſecret ambitious deſire, to purchaſe an opinion and reputation of holineſs to himſelf, or from any other by-end, but from an heart truly humbled with ſight and ſence of its own infirmities, graciouſly reſolved into compaſſion, and commiſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the offender, and lifted up in a ſecret ſupplication for the ſucceſs of the Reproof, and ſalvation of the party, all at once to Gods Throne of Grace.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Apprehend all opportunities and occurrences which may miniſter matter of digreſſion from worldly talk, into Divine diſcourſe. It is pity that Profeſſors ſhould ever meet, without ſome talk of their meeting in heaven, or of the bleſſed ways and means that lead thereunto; and therefore by ſome wiſe tranſciſion, turn thou the current of the diſcourſe towards ſome heavenly good: It was the practice of our Savior, upon men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of bread, he preſt upon his Diſciples a diſſwaſion from the <hi>Leaven of the Phariſees:</hi>

Have ever in a readineſs ſome common heads of more ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and quickning motives to minde heavenly things; as the curſed condition of our natural ſtate, the dear purchaſe of Chriſt to Redeem our ſouls, the incomparable ſweetneſs of Chriſtian ways, the vanity and vexation of earthly things, the uncertainty and miſery of this ſhort life, the everlaſtingneſs of our ſtate in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other world, the terrors of death, the dreadfulneſs of that great and laſt day drawing on now apace, the horrors of damned ſouls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mention of theſe things many times may ſtrike full cold to the heart of the moſt ſenſual <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> and drive him into his dumps; and by Gods bleſſing may ſometimes prepare the hardeſt hearts, for ſome thoughts of remorſe, and more heavenly impreſſions.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Get we into our hearts an habit of more heavenly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by much exerciſe, and intercourſe, and acquaintance with God, by often contemplation, and forecaſt of the ſweetneſs, glory, and eternity of thoſe Manſions above, by reflectings on time paſt, how long thy ſoul was detained in the ſtate of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, what bitterneſs and terrors it paſſed through in the pangs of its new birth, what relapſes and deſertions it hath been inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to, ever ſince that time to this; and being thus buſied at home in our own hearts, we ſhall finde our ſelves much more pregnant and plentiful in holy talk when we come abroad: Men for the moſt part ſpeak moſt, and moſt willingly of thoſe things they minde moſt; ſuch proviſions within, will make the <hi>tongue</hi> ſo ready, that it cannot be unſeaſonably idle.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Watch we muſt over the <hi>tongue,</hi> that it be not <hi>ſinfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed:</hi> And herein obſerve theſe Directions: —</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Be ſilent from Slandering, Backbiting, Falſe accuſing, Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring: A true heart is ever moſt angry and diſpleaſed with, moſt Eagle-eyed, and watchful over, moſt ſtrict and ſevere againſt its own ſins; which homebred imployment haply hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and moderates a man from too much medling abroad.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Concerning Natural actions, as <hi>Eating, Drinking, Sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Viſitations, Recreations,</hi> &amp;c. no conſtant Rule can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, becauſe it is much diverſified by health, ſickneſs, age, conſtitution; and every one hath either learned by his own experience, what ſeaſons, and proportions of ſuch natural helps are fitteſt for his temperament, or he is moſt unworthy of that precious thing (an Underſtanding ſoul) which he bears in his boſom; onely let me inform Chriſtians, that they may ſin in any of theſe actions, and therefore let them beware and watch over themſelves in the uſe and enjoyment of theſe things; which howſoever lawful in their own nature, yet by our corruption are capable of inordinateneſs and exceſs. Some are of opinion, That Chriſtians are in more danger of being Spiritually undone, by a ſlie inſinuation and inſnarement of licentiouſneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderation
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:117624:40"/> in ſuch lawful things, then by the groſs aſſaults of foul ſins and temptations; their hearts may riſe againſt any work of darkneſs, as Adultery, Murther, Swearing, Prophaning the Lords day, Speculative wantonneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which yet may too often be inſenſibly ſeized upon, by an exceſſive ſinful delight, in things unſinful in themſelves; and therefore we had need to watch over our Natural actions.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Concerning Civil actions, as <hi>Bargains, Contracts, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, Dealings, Negotiations,</hi> &amp;c. obſerve theſe Directions:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Think we ſeriouſly and ſolemnly of that Principle, <hi>Do as thou wouldst be done by:</hi> In a fellow-feeling real conceit, put thy ſelf into the place, and impartially put on the perſon of the party with whom thou art to deal, and then returning to thy ſelf, deal out and proportion unto him that meaſure in every particular, which thou wouldſt be willing to receive at anothers hand,<note place="margin">Mat 7.22.</note> if thou wer't in his caſe: <hi>Whatſoever</hi> (ſaith our Savior) <hi>ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.</hi>

O conſider we the vanity of theſe earthly things! Conſider we the glories above! Methinks this one preſervative would be powerful enough to keep the heart of every Chriſtian from doting upon the world, or ſuffering it to be poſſeſſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it is this, Every Chriſtian by a fruitful Faith, may be aſſured of a Crown of life, either by aſſurance of adherence, or evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or both: Now if that once a day he ſhould take a ſerious ſurvey of the glory, everlaſtingneſs, and unutterable excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of that immortal Crown, which our dear Redeemer holds for him in his hand, ready to ſet upon his head, when he ſhall be diſſolved from this vale of tears; Methinks it were able ſo

Then, before we fall on our knees, let us ſhake off three impoyſoning and heavy hindrances, which otherwiſe will clog and clip the wings of our Prayers, that they will never be able to aſcend up into heaven; as, Sin, Anger, and Diſtruſt: and let us poſſeſs our ſelves of three excellent helps and inflaming fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therances; the firſt is a right apprehenſion of Gods Dreadful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Purity, Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſecond is, a true ſence of our own Vileneſs, Abominableneſs, Nothingneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The third is, an hearty ſurvey of the Infiniteneſs, and unexpreſſibleneſs of Gods

                  <p n="1">1. That after we have examined, we then compare our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, with our former eſtate, and conſider whether we have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed or decayed in grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That if we have profited in grace, we then conſider by what means we have profited, that ſo we may make more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant uſe of ſuch means; or if we have decayed in grace, we
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:117624:42"/> then obſerve by what temptations we were overcome, that ſo our former errors may make us more wary, and more reſolute againſt them for the future.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That as we meet with any occaſions of moment, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which we had a purpoſe to better our Spiritual eſtate, we then recal home our thoughts, and make uſe of our former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, and practice what we did purpoſe. — Out of all theſe laid together, we may more fully deſcribe it thus:</p>

                  <p n="2">2. In <hi>Special,</hi> whether of our Calling or Nature: Theſe ſins may breed ſpecial danger, becauſe we are ready to drop into them of our own diſpoſitions; and therefore in the daily care of our ſouls, we had need to examine our ſelves concerning theſe ſins.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As we muſt examine our evil works, ſo our good works.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe we are many times deceived with ſhews, thinking that good which is evil: Thus <hi>Paul</hi> thought he ſhewed much zeal, when he <hi>perſecuted the Churches of Chriſt;</hi>

                  <p>THat we may examine our ſins of all ſorts, obſerve theſe Rules:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Procure we a Catalogue of our ſins, both before, and ſince our converſion; and to that purpoſe, go we through the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments one by one, and in each of them conſider what ſins are condemned, and what <hi>Duties</hi> are enjoyned: And hereupon queſtion with our own hearts, <hi>Whether have I committed this or that ſin?</hi> 2. <hi>Whether have I neglected this or that Duty?</hi> and as the heart anſwers, be ready to note down thoſe ſins whereof we ſtand guilty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſins thus found out, make we a ſolemn Confeſſion to God, with deep Humiliation; let them be dolorous Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, with grief and ſorrow for ſin, and from a ſight and ſence of it: Thus <hi>Ephraim</hi> did, and God was feign to acknowledge it,<note place="margin">Ier 31.18.</note> 
                     <hi>I have ſurely heard Ephraim bemoan himſelf:</hi> O the Lord
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:117624:43"/> loves to hear ſuch bemoaning <hi>Ephraims,</hi> and ſuch bemoaning Confeſſions.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The ſins thus confeſſed and bewailed, let us judge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn our ſelves: This is that <hi>Duty</hi> inſtanced in by the Apoſtle, <hi>If we would judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.31.</note> There is a Tribunal that we ſhould every one erect within us, where Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is the Accuſer, Reaſon the Judge, Fear the Goaler, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the Executioner.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. After we have thus judged our ſelves, let us then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to Gods Throne of Grace; let us deſire of God ſalvation in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; let us caſt all our confidence on him; who never fails them that put their truſt in him, and in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Merits.</p>

                  <p>THat we may examine our ſpecial ſins, our <hi>Dalilah</hi> ſins, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve we theſe Rules:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Endeavor we to finde out this ſin; and in our ſcrutiny, our examination, we may diſcover it by theſe marks:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it is the <hi>Dalilah,</hi> which thy own Conſcience and the finger of God in the Miniſtery many times meets with, and chiefly checks thee for.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That which thou art lotheſt to leave, haſt leaſt power to reſiſt, and which moſt hinders the reſignation and ſubmiſſion of thy ſoul and body to the Word and Will of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That which God often corrects in thee, even in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation and guilty acknowledgement of thy ſelf-accuſing heart; and if ever the ſword of the Spirit ſhall cleave it from thy boſom (which is infinitely to be deſired) it will coſt the bittereſt tears, and deepeſt groans.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Thoughts, Plots, and Projects about it (a thouſand to one) ordinarily ſeize upon thy heart at the very firſt waking, if they have not broken thy ſleep, and troubled thee in thy dreams.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſin once found out, do we purſue it, and make we a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Confeſſion to God of it; mourn we under it, and deſire we help from God for his mortifying Grace.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:117624:44"/>3. Settle we in our ſelves a purpoſe of heart, to forbear it for time to come: In undertaking of which purpoſe, it will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to ſet our ſelves ſome ſhort ſpace of time, as for a day or a moneth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and when the prefixed time is come, we ſhould then queſtion our ſelves, How well we have performed? or how, or wherein we have failed? and then begin a new purpoſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Be we ever jealous of our ſelves, and of our infirmity and proneneſs to this ſin. Now we have two grounds of this jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie:
<list>
                        <item>1. Leſt we be deceived about it.</item>
                        <item>2. Leſt we be overtaken with it.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. We may be deceived, in ſuppoſing that we are utterly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced, and quite delivered from this boſom-ſin, when it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo; as thus:—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We may change onely in the outward form, and not in truth: For inſtance, whereas the ſame ſin of <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> doth utter and expreſs it ſelf by Uſury, Symony, Sacriledge, Bribery, Grinding the faces of the poor, Detaining ill-gotten goods, without reſtitution; we may perhaps inſenſibly glide out of one gulf of griping cruelty into another, or it may be from one of theſe more notorious, to ſome other leſs obſerved, and leſs odious in the world, and yet ſtill abide in the chambers of Death, and under the tyranny of this reigning ſin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We may ſurceaſe, and refrain from the outward groſs acts of ſuch hateful villanies, and yet our inwards be ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with inſatiable, ſenſual hankerings after them: For inſtance, Whereas the foul ſin of Uncleanneſs doth actuate it ſelf by Fornication, Adultery, Self-pollution, immoderate abuſe of the Marriage-bed, Speculative wantonneſs, we may perhaps forbear the external acts of uncleanneſs, and yet lie and languiſh in the delightful revolvings of them in our minde, in adulteries of thought.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We may change the kinde of our boſom-ſin, in reſpect of the matter, form, object, every way; and yet upon the matter it ſelf, it is but the exchange of one foul fiend for another: For inſtance, Wantonneſs may be our ſweet ſin in youth, and World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in old age; Hypocriſie may reign at one time, Apoſtacy at another; Furious Zeal for one while, Prophane Irreligiouſneſs for another.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:117624:44"/>4. We may for a time pull our necks out of this ſtrong yoke of Satan (out of a melancholick pang of ſlaviſh terror, ſerious fore-thought of death, lying everlaſtingly in Hell) but becauſe it is not the work of the word, humbling us ſoundly under Gods mighty hand, planting Faith, and infuſing mortifying power, anon will this unclean Spirit return, and rule in us again far more imperiouſly then before.— I know it is not impoſſible, but that a man after his converſion, by the ſudden ſurpriſal of ſome violent temptation, and cunning train of Satan, may be haled back to commit his ſweet ſin again (though it be an heavy caſe, and to be lamented, if it were poſſible, with tears of blood) yet he never doth, nor never can return to wallow in it again, or to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it: Here is the difference, The temporary man, after his formal enforced forbearance, engulphs himſelf again with more greedineſs into the ſenſuality and pleaſures of his boſom-ſin, he lies in it, and delights in it, and hardens himſelf more obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in it: but the ſound convert after a relapſe, his heart bleeds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh with extraordinary bitterneſs, and he cryes more mightily to God, for the return of his pleaſed countenance, and he prayes, and fortifies the breach with ſtronger reſolution, and more invincible <hi>watchfulneſs</hi> againſt future aſſaults; obſerve then, if our change be but formal, outward, miſtaken, tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, we are utterly deceived, and therefore we had need to be jealous of our ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We may be overtaken with this ſin, before we be aware; our nature is very apt to take fire, our corrupt heart is like Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or Gunpowder: This ſin is called <hi>Pecatum in deliciis,</hi> our darling pleaſure, our minion delight; it is ever ready at every turn to allure us, tempt us, perſwade us; and the ſoul by a ſecret ſenſual inclination is apt to follow it, to feed upon it, with much affectionate ſweetneſs: It may be we have ſometimes given it a deaths wound, by the power of his might, who is our all in all, and yet as it is ſaid of the firſt Beaſt, this <hi>deadly wound is ready to be healed again;</hi> it is an <hi>Hydra</hi> with many heads,<note place="margin">Rev. 13.12.</note> and if we be not ſtill hacking and hewing, it will revive and recollect ſtrength, and at laſt rage more then before; and therefore what need have we to this holy jealouſie?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Above all, without which all the reſt are nothing, believe we the Promiſes of Pardon, and of Sanctification: The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:117624:45"/> of the firſt ſort, I ſpoke to in our <hi>Watchfulneſs</hi> over this ſin, and therefore now I ſhall ſpeak of the latter. The Lord hath <hi>promiſed to deliver us from all our enemies,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 1 72, 74, 75. Heb. 10.16.</note> 
                     <hi>that we may ſerve him in righteouſneſs and holineſs all the days of our life;</hi> The Lord hath <hi>promiſed to write his Law in our hearts,</hi> and that can never be, except he obliterate all the old-writing: Now then believe theſe Promiſes, and preſs the Lord with them, or we ſhall never be able to outwreſtle our luſts; what though we finde our ſweet ſins, confeſs them, reſolve againſt them, be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous over them? unleſs we go to God and Chriſt in the Promiſes for ſtrength, we ſhall <hi>lie down in ſorrow:</hi> Could we of our ſelves ſubdue our Corruptions, God would not take this upon him, to give us new hearts, and new Spirits, to ſanctifie us, to make us new creatures, to crucifie the fleſh, to weaken the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of ſin: Alas, he knows our weakneſs, and he knows all is in his own power; and therefore if we would mortifie theſe luſts, we muſt go to him, and beſeech him to do it. When a man is once in Chriſt, he lives by a Principle without himſelf: <hi>I live by the faith of the Son of God</hi> (ſaid <hi>Paul) who loved me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> 
                     <hi>and gave himſelf for me:</hi> If we ask, Why will the Lord have our ſtrength out of our ſelves? why may not a man have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient habitual ſtrength in himſelf, by which he may be able to outwreſtle luſts, and overcome temptations? The reaſon is, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no fleſh ſhall rejoyce in it ſelf, and therefore Chriſt is made Sanctification unto us: O let us believe theſe Promiſes, and have continual dependance on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>THat we may rightly examine our hearts, obſerve we theſe Rules:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Uſe we retiredneſs when we fall on this work: To this purpoſe,<note place="margin">Pſal. 4.4.</note> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Commune with your own hearts on your beds, and be ſtill:</hi> When we get alone purpoſely to ſtudy our hearts, our hearts will then come to us, they will be more
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:117624:45"/> apt to diſcourſe with us privately, then in a crowd; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſet we ſome time apart out of our publike or particular occaſions to deal with our hearts, as <hi>David, who after the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like buſineſs was done, turned home to viſit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Sam 6.20.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Examine what thoughts are within, and which way runs the ſtream of our thoughts: The heart is an houſe of common reſort, into which multitudes of thoughts, like ſo many gueſts, enter, and have free and open acceſs; onely if it be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, it ordinarily diſtils holy, ſweet, and uſeful Meditations out of all objects; as the Bee ſucks honey out of every flower, and a good ſtomack ſucks ſweet and wholeſom nouriſhment out of what it takes to it ſelf: So doth a holy heart (ſo far as ſanctified) convert and digeſt all into Spiritual and uſeful thoughts: But on the contrary, if it be wicked, then a world of vain, light, wanton, prophane, and diſſolute thoughts lodge there, and defile thoſe rooms they lodge in; which made the Lord ſay to <hi>Jeruſalem, O Jeruſalem,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. If upon examination we finde a lothneſs to entertain holy thoughts, and unſteadineſs in them, a miſplacing of them (which diſorder is a vanity and ſin, be the thought materially never ſo good) or if we finde in us many times a taking <hi>thought to fulfil the luſts of the fleſh,</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. For the work of ſaving grace or Converſion, examine—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whether ever our ſouls were wounded by a clear diſcovery and wide opening of our many ulcerous ſecret corruptions? Whether ever they were affected and preſſed with a through ſence and feeling of the fierce wrath of God, ready to break out into unquenchable flames of vengeance againſt us?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whether after theſe bruiſings and breakings, our ſouls ever caſt their eyes upon that infinite ſea of Gods mercy, gloriouſly ſtreaming through the bleeding wounds of Jeſus Chriſt upon every truly broken, contrite and wounded heart? Whether ever they ſetled and faſtned their ſight ſtedfaſtly upon their bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Redeemer, as he was hanging on the Croſs, ſtrugling with his Fathers wrath for our ſins, and crying out at laſt, <hi>It is finiſhed?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whether after this ſight, and conſideration of the work of our Redemption, our ſouls ever hungred and thirſted after the precious blood of the Lord Jeſus, far more greedily and inſatiably, then ever the panting heart thirſted after the rivers of water? Whether ever with ſtrong cryes, prays, groans and ſighs, they threw themſelves with ſome comfort and confidence into the bleeding and bleſſed boſom of our dear Redeemer, and there hid themſelves ſweetly and deeply in his ſacred wounds, and goared ſide, from the eager purſuit of the wounding Law, the rage of Satan, and ſtingings of their own Conſciences?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Whether after this faſt-hold upon the Paſſion and Merits of Chriſt, our ſouls ever received this comfortable news, That we were pardoned, juſtified, intitled by the Covenant of grace unto a Crown of Immortality, and endleſs joys in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens? Whether this ever melted us into an Evangelical Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to bewail heartily all our ſins, and former wretchedneſs of life, for having ſo vilely and rebelliouſly grieved and offended ſo gracious and loving a Father?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Whether after theſe comforts and ſorrows, our ſouls ever reſolutely abandoned the practice of every groſs ſin, and threw out of their affections the liking and allowance of every the leaſt infirmity? Whether we have ever ſince ſetled our ſelves to holineſs of life, univerſal obedience to all Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, though not in perfection and height of degree, yet in truth and ſincerity of heart?</p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:117624:48"/>
                  <p>It maybe every ſoul (truly converted) cannot ſpeak affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to every of theſe <hi>Quaeres</hi> in intention, or height of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, though for the ſubſtance they can; and if ſo, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, there is <hi>the work of ſaving grace.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. What ſenſible and quickning communion we have with Chriſt in our Duties? This is the main buſineſs and end of all the Ordinances of Chriſt. It is ordinary with us to terminate our Devotions with a circular courſe of praying Morning and Evening, or of coming to Church every Lords day; we look no further, but onely to the exerciſe of the body, we ſee not any thing in the power of Chriſt ſhining out in ſtrength in theſe <hi>Duties:</hi> And therefore examine we particularly—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whether we have (in the uſe of any Divine Ordinance) an intimate, tender and effectual preſence of Chriſt himſelf with us?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whether we have a conſtant influence, a quickning power of Spiritual refreſhing, a ſenſible Spiritual taſte of Divine love, or of God himſelf by this preſence of Chriſt? In right per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of <hi>Duties,</hi> we come to have fuller Union with Chriſt, and by this coming to him, we come to, and ſee the Father by him: And hence follows by this preſence of Chriſt, theſe three things, 1. Peace with, and a Spiritual joy in God: 2. A ſtrength communicated to walk with Chriſt, and in his power with God. 3. A ſealed aſſurance of eternal communion with God in glory.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For <hi>Graces,</hi> examine —</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The truth of our Graces.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The growth of our Graces.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The wants of our Graces: All which we ſhall diſcuſs at large in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.</p>

                  <p>THe Scriptures have determined no ſet time, yet ſome rules there are, partly in Scripture, and partly preſcribed by holy men, which we may make uſe of, as thus:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is no danger of ſurfetting upon too much; the oftner we reckon with our ſouls, the fewer things we ſhall have to reckon for every time; and the fewer things there be, the more readily will they be called to minde, and more exactly be ſcanned: This made <hi>Bernard</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The time that learned and devout men commend to us, is once every day: So <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi>

                     <hi>Let this account be kept every day; — Have a little book in thy Conſcience, and write therein thy daily tranſgreſſions; and when thou layeſt thee down on thy bed, then bring forth thy book, and take an account of thy ſins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The time that eſpecially Scripture holds forth to us, is at evening or at night: <hi>I call to remembrance,</hi> ſaid <hi>David,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal 77.6.</note>

                  <p n="4">4. Other times may be as occaſion requires: When the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in diſtreſs, and ſighed to God, then they encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged each other, <hi>Let us ſearch and try our ways,</hi>

                     <hi>and turn again to the Lord.</hi> When Chriſtians purpoſe to receive the Lords Supper, then <hi>Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.28.</note> When we obſerve days of Faſt for humiliation of our ſouls; or when we obſerve a Sabbath of Feaſts, or eſpecially when we are caſt down upon our ſick beds, and in expectation of our diſſolution, then it's time to <hi>examine, and to judge our ſelves,</hi>

                     <hi>that we be not judged.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Beſides thoſe daily and caſual times, it is convenient alſo,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:117624:49"/> after ſome good ſpace of time, to examine our ſelves over again, <hi>ex. gr.</hi> after a moneth or a year, to conſider our ſelves for the moneth or year paſt, that we may ſee how we have profited or decayed for that ſpace of time; for as our members grow, and our ſhape every day changeth, and our black hairs turn gray, while we perceive it not, yet after ſome ſpace of time, we may eaſily diſcern; ſo it is in our ſouls, beſides the manifeſt changes which ſometimes appear at the inſtant, there are certain inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible alterations, which are not to be diſcerned, but after ſome continuance of time: And for rectifying of theſe, it is neceſſary to take a more general view of our ſouls, in a monethly or year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examination; by this means we ſhall ſee wherein we are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or worſe, how our zeal is encreaſed or decreaſed; if we are bettered ſince our laſt general account, we ſhall have occaſion to praiſe God; if otherwiſe, we muſt therefore be humbled, and blow the coals of zeal, and ſtir up the grace of God in us, that we may <hi>ſtrengthen the things which remain,</hi>

                  <p>To this purpoſe we read of many Ancients that were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to keep Diaries or Day-books of their actions, and out of them to take an account of their lives: Such a Regiſter (of Gods dealings towards him, and of his dealings towards God in main things) the Lord put into a poor creatures heart to keep in the year 1641. ever ſince which time he hath continued it, and once a year purpoſes (by Gods grace) to examine himſelf by it; the uſe and end of it is this:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hereby he obſerves ſomething of God to his ſoul, and of his ſoul to God. 2. Upon occaſion he pours out his ſoul to God in prayer accordingly, and either is humbled or thankful. 3. He conſiders how it is with him in reſpect of time paſt, and if he have profited in grace, to finde out the means whereby he hath profited, that he may make more conſtant uſe of ſuch means; or wherein he hath decayed, to obſerve by what tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation he was overcome, that his former errors may make him more wary for the future.</p>
                  <p>Beſides many other uſes, as of his own <hi>Experiences</hi> and <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,</hi> which he may (by the Lords help) gather out of this Diary.</p>

                        <hi>May</hi> 20. This day in the Evening the Lord in his mercy poured into my ſoul the raviſhing joy of his bleſſed Spirit. O how ſweet was the Lord unto me? I never felt ſuch a lovely taſte of Heaven before: I believe this was <hi>the joyful ſound,</hi> the <hi>Kiſſes of his mouth,</hi> the <hi>Sweetneſſes of Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Joy of his Spirit, the new wine of his kingdom;</hi> it continued with me about two days.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Feb.</hi> 2. I Preached (at the deſire of the people) the firſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon that ever was Preached in <hi>Garſtange</hi> Chappel: I hope a bleſſed beginning, the Lord proſper the Word in that place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Feb.</hi> 5. The Lord (as once before wonderfully) ſo this day again delivered me from the danger of fire, which had ſeized on ſome part of the houſe or ſtuff in it where I lived.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>May</hi> 15. I firſt Preached againſt all Superſtitious vanities, and particularly againſt the Croſs in Baptiſm: This was the firſt
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:117624:50"/> occaſion of the peoples general diſcontent, ever ſince when ſome of them have been irreconcileable: Now begun the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Church and State.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Novemb.</hi> 15. I was taken Priſoner, but ſome Gentlemen offered themſelves to be bound for my appearing when called; and ſo the Lord ſet me free: Now began the troubleſom times; and this year the Lord many a time aſſiſted me in the Preaching of his Word boldly to the Enemy, both above ordinary, and far above my ſelf.</p>

A Faſt was upon the occaſion obſerved in <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter.</hi> In my preparation unto it (reading in the Bible) I light upon <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.17.—51.12, 13. After the Duty begun, the Lord kept my heart up as in a flame: The day was ſweetly obſerved, but the Concluſion of it (when Mr. <hi>Angier</hi> prayed) was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſweet; his Prayer was ſo working, that I believe it melted all hearts: and for my own, it pleaſed the Lord ſo to ſoften it, and break it, that (ſo far as I can remember) it was never in ſuch a melting frame in any publike Ordinance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aug.</hi> 22. I returned to <hi>Preſton,</hi> and ſaw the wonderful works of God, and heard of many miracles of Mercies; — as 1. That the Infantry of the Scots was ruined, 150 Colours taken from them, 36 Barrels of Powder, 100 Barrels of Match, 6000 weight of Bullet, 5000 Muskets, 2000 Pikes, the Enemy being above 30000, and the Parliament forces not above 9000.— 2. That no place (whither the Enemy came) eſcaped Plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, except <hi>Preſton,</hi> which was prevented by the Armies coming in the very nick of time.— 3. That proviſion of meat was brought into the Town-Hall for the Scots, to the value of a thouſand pounds at leaſt, but the Armies ſeaſonable march ſaved that proviſion for themſelves.—4. That ſome of the Scots in the pangs of death cryed out, <hi>They had broken the Covenant,</hi> notwithſtanding that the word <hi>COVENANT</hi> was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven in their Colours. Upon meditation of the whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I believed that the Lord heard <hi>my Prayers:</hi> 1. In that my heart ſympathized: 2. In that my heart was filled with joy in the accompliſhment: 3. In that the Mercy concerned me, in reſpect of my perſon, Family, Congregation, as much as any other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aug.</hi> 30. and 31. we obſerved as days of publike Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving to God.</p>

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:117624:55"/> firſt, together with his Lady; and the other Son having a Maid to wait upon him, ſhe brought the Peſtilence into the family, of which his Son and Heir dyed alſo: He himſelf (now being in a Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption) ſaid, That he knew his houſe was come to its period. About this time his fair houſe was made a Gariſon, by which means all his Barns and buildings about it were pulled down; but the ſtorm being over, he began to repair the houſe, and two Workmen being lately come out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> having the bloody Flux, brought that diſeaſe into the Family; hereupon he removed: And when the houſe was clear, he returned, and began again to repair the Building; but then the Peſtilence by ſome means or other was brought into the Family, and ſo he was forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move again: The houſe once again cleanſed, he (being now far ſpent in his Conſumption) deſired two days before his death to be carried to it, ſaying, <hi>He muſt be the laſt of that houſe, and he would dye where his Father dyed before him;</hi> accordingly his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants conveyed him thither in a Chair. His great affliction was the want of an Heir, and eſpecially that he knew none of his own Name in <hi>England</hi> (except Baſtards) to whom he might convey his Eſtate: But after much enquiry, he was reſolved that there was a Gentleman near his Name (it being but a ſyllable longer) who lived near the City of <hi>Y.</hi> This pleaſed him ſo well, that he made him (though a ſtranger) the Heir of all his Lands: In the mean while one of his Siſters dyed, and he himſelf (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conveyed as aforeſaid) dyed in the ſame place he ſo much deſired. There was none now alive of that Family, except one Siſter, and ſhe not long after his death, dyed alſo; at whoſe very time of death (as it was obſerved by ſtrict calculation) a fire (not known certainly how) ſeized on that ſtately Hall, which was ſo vehement, that none could quench it, till at leaſt two parts of it were burnt to the very ground. <hi>Here's a Looking-glaſs for all unclean perſons, and vain-glorious world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>EXperience</hi> (ſay ſome) is a knowledge and diſcovery of ſomething by ſence not evident in it ſelf, but manifeſted by ſome event or effect. This deſcription contains both Natural and Spiritual <hi>Experience;</hi> but my purpoſe is to ſpeak onely of the latter, and in that reſpect I look ſtrictly at <hi>Experiences,</hi> as <hi>Real proofs of Scripture truths.</hi> When I mark how true every part of Gods Word is, how all the Doctrines, Threatnings and Promiſes contained therein, are daily verified in others, and in my own ſelf, and ſo improve, or make uſe of them to my own Spiritual advantage, this I call <hi>Experience.</hi>

                  <p>THat our <hi>Experiences</hi> may further us in the way to Heaven, we muſt learn 1. To gather them: 2. To improve them. 1. For the gathering of them, the onely way is —</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To mark things which fall out; To obſerve the beginnings and events of matters, to eye them every way, on every ſide, that they may ſtand us in ſtead for the future: This obſervation and pondering of events, with the cauſes that went before, is the ripener of wit;<note place="margin">Iſa. 42.23. Pſal. 107.43.</note> 
                     <hi>Who among you will give ear to this? who will hearken for the time to come? Whoſo is wiſe, and will obſerve thoſe things, even they ſhall underſtand the loving kindeneſs of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To treaſure up, and lay in theſe obſervations, to have ready in remembrance ſuch works of God as we have known and obſerved. The Philoſopher ſaith, that <hi>Experience</hi> is <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex memoria, A multiplied memory,</hi> becauſe of the memory of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:117624:57"/> the ſame thing often done, ariſeth <hi>Experience: I remember the days of old,</hi> ſaith <hi>David;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 143.5.</note> I remember how thou didſt rebuke <hi>Abimelech,</hi> and overthrew <hi>Nimrod,</hi> and <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and <hi>Ahito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel:</hi> and thus would we treaſure up <hi>Experiments,</hi> the former part of our life would come in to help the latter, and the longer we live, the richer in Faith we ſhould be; even as in Victories, every former overthrow of an Enemy, helps to obtain a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Victory. This is the uſe of a ſanctified memory, it will loſe nothing that may help in time of need, or in the evil day; it records all the breathings, movings, ſtirrings, workings of a ſoul towards Chriſt, or of Chriſt towards a ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To caſt theſe things thus marked and laid in under ſeveral Spiritual heads, of <hi>Promiſes, Threats, Deceits of the heart, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties of Satan, Allurements of the world,</hi> &amp;c. I might inlarge the Heads into any thing that is <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil:</hi> 1. Into any thing that is <hi>good,</hi> whether it be <hi>God,</hi> or the <hi>things given us by God;</hi> his Spirit, his Councels, his Ordinances, his Work of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all the fruits of the Spirit. 2. Into any thing that is <hi>evil,</hi> whether it be <hi>Sin,</hi> or <hi>the fruits of Sin,</hi> as Corruption, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability to good, vanity of all the Creatures, the Judgements of God. Thus we muſt ſort our <hi>Experiences,</hi> as the Apothecary ſorteth his Drugs.</p>

                     <hi>and to ſing praiſes unto thy name, O moſt High:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal 4.18. Heb. 13.9.</note>— <hi>It is good to be zealouſly affected always in a good thing:— It is a good thing that the heart be eſtabliſhed with grace;</hi> or if by <hi>Experience</hi> we diſcern the <hi>evil</hi> of ſin it ſelf out of meaſure ſinful,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.13.</note> according to that Text, <hi>Sin by the Commandment is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come exceeding ſinful:</hi> If we finde out the corruption of our own Nature,<note place="margin">Pſa. 51.5.</note> according to that Text, <hi>Behold, I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my mother conceive me:</hi> If we diſcover the abomination of our own righteouſneſs, according to that Text,<note place="margin">Iſa. 64.6.</note> 
                     <hi>We are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteouſneſs are as filthy rags:</hi> If we feel our own inabilities to do any good, according to that Text,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.18.</note> 
                     <hi>To will is preſent with me; but how to perform that which is good, I finde not: — Not that we are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient of our ſelves,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor 3.5.</note> 
                     <hi>to think any thing as of our ſelves, but our ſufficiency is of God:</hi> If we have tryal of the vanity of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as of Riches, Honor, Wiſdom, according to that Text, <hi>Vanity of vanities,</hi>

                     <hi>all is vanity:</hi> O how will theſe bleſſed <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences,</hi> backed by Scripture truths, kindle our affections! I deny not, Faith works more ſtedfaſtneſs, and firmneſs of adherence, but <hi>Experience</hi> uſually breeds the greater ſtrength of affections: <hi>I love the Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 116.1.</note> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) and why ſo? <hi>becauſe</hi> (of this <hi>Experience) he hath heard my voyce, and my ſupplications.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. We muſt endeavor to produce that fruit, that frame of heart, which the Lord requires, directs, and looks for in ſuch and ſuch caſes.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:117624:58"/> more ſtrongly confirmed; the deceitful heart more narrowly watched; Satans ſuggeſtions more watchfully reſiſted; the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witchings of the world kept at a greater diſtance from the ſoul; in a word, when by this experimental application of Gods works to his word, God is more advanced, and Self more abaſed, the honor of the Lord is more ſtudied, and the edification of his people endeavored, holy love encreaſed, ſervice quickned, faith ſtrengthned, Chriſt improved; then is this buſineſs Chriſtianly managed indeed.

                  <p>THe Sanctification of <hi>Experiences</hi> is evidenced (as we ſaid) by ſuch <hi>Dispoſitions</hi> as theſe: —</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When Divine diſcoveries are more ſtrongly believed; this is one fruit of <hi>Experience,</hi> it wonderfully ſtrengthens our faith: When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſaw the <hi>Egyptians</hi> drowned, then <hi>they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Lord, and his ſervant Moſes.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 14 31.</note> When we finde all things in the event to be as we believed, this confirms our Faith, as <hi>David knew that God favored him, by his deliverances.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal 41.11.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. When the heart by threats is more kindely awed: This another fruit of <hi>Experience,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 52.6.</note> 
                     <hi>The righteous alſo ſhall ſee and fear;</hi> firſt <hi>ſee,</hi> and then <hi>fear:</hi> When the Primitive Chriſtians ſaw <hi>Ananias fall down, and give up the ghoſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 5.5.</note> then <hi>great fear came on them that heard thoſe things;</hi> this holy fear many a time poſſeſſeth the Saints:<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.120.</note> 
                     <hi>My fleſh trembled for fear of thee</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) and I am afraid of thy judgements.— When I heard, my belly trembled</hi> (ſaith <hi>Habakkuk) my lip quivered at the voyce;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hab. 3.16.</note> 
                     <hi>rottenneſs entred into my bones, and I trembled in my ſelf, that I might reſt in the day of trouble:</hi> As the childe quaketh when he ſeeth his Father correct a ſervant, ſo the faithful tremble when they obſerve the ſeverity of Gods wrath againſt impenitent ſinners.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When the deceitful heart is more narrowly watched: Hath it cozened us once and again? <hi>Experience</hi> hereof will
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:117624:59"/> breed in us a godly jealouſie and ſuſpition over our hearts; we are now conſcious of our own weakneſs, and of the ſnare that is in every creature, to take and entangle us; and this will make waking Believers circumſpect and careful, how they entertain evil motions, how they keep up holy thoughts, how they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form holy <hi>duties,</hi> how their affections move towards that which is above, leſt they ſhould miſcarry upon the ſands.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When Satans ſuggeſtions are more watchfully reſiſted, this is the voyce of <hi>Experience</hi> in ſuch a caſe, <hi>Doth Satan furiouſly aſſail us? be not diſmayed; Are his temptations moſt fierce? be we moſt diligent in the means of grace, the practice of holineſs, the labors of an honest calling; Pray earneſtly, exerciſe faith, ſtick faster to the word of promiſe, ſtop our ears againſt ſcruples and doubtings; Draw nigh to God, for Satan will then ceaſe to vex thee with his temptations any more: Reſiſt the Devil, and he will fly from you:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lam. 4.7.</note> it is true, the Believer is too weak of himſelf to withſtand the leaſt aſſault, but if we relie on the Lord, we may through his power be made victorious in the greateſt aſſaults whatſoever; and here is the comfort of <hi>Experience,</hi> That a Soul having once returned with victory, through the power of his might, <hi>He will abide in the ſecret place of the moſt high for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. When the bewitchings of the world are kept at a great diſtance from the Soul: This was <hi>Solomons</hi> caſe and cure, after all his travels and great delights, he no ſooner returns <hi>as to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccle. 1.2.</note> but he fills the world with this news; What news? <hi>Vanity,</hi> And what more? <hi>Vanity of vanities;</hi> And what more? <hi>All is vanity: Experience</hi> of its <hi>vanity,</hi> weans him from the love of this earth, it takes him off the creature, and lifts him unto the Lord his Creator; ſo ſhould we (if ever we were charmed with ſuch <hi>Syren</hi> ſongs) be more careful, leſt we be drawn away with the pleaſing delights of things tranſitory, and keep them at a greater diſtance from us.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. When the Lord Jeſus is more ſtudied and advanced: The man that feels Chriſts gracious power and vertue, will be ſure to exalt Chriſt, and ſet him up on high; when Iſrael ſaw the mighty work of <hi>David</hi> in overthrowing <hi>Goliah,</hi> then <hi>David</hi> was much ſet by: The Believers <hi>experience</hi> of Chriſts mighty and gracious working, makes Chriſt very precious to him, then
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:117624:59"/> he cryes, as the Soldiers of <hi>David,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Sam. 18.3.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou art worth ten thouſands of us:</hi> Hence it is that Gods people value him above all their profits, friends, eaſe, credit and lives. <hi>Matthew</hi> left the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of Cuſtom, <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> their Ships, and Nets, and Father, <hi>and followed him,</hi> yea,<note place="margin">Rev. 12.11.</note> 
                     <hi>many for his ſake loved not their lives unto death;</hi> no wonder they had many ſweet <hi>experiences</hi> of Chriſt: Chriſt to their apprehenſion was <hi>the faireſt of ten thouſand,</hi> none but Chriſt, none but Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. When the peoples edification is endeavored: Have we taſted of the goodneſs of God? let us then provoke others to believe, and to ſerve the Lord together with us; this is one end of <hi>Experience,</hi> and that uſe we ſhould make of it towards others. When <hi>Gideon</hi> heard the telling of the dream, and the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation thereof, he worſhipped, and turned into the hoſt of Iſrael, and ſaid, <hi>Ariſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iudges 7.15.</note> 
                     <hi>for the Lord hath delivered the hoſt of Midian into your hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. When a mans own ſelf is more abaſed: Do we live the life of grace and true holineſs? this will teach us to deny our ſelves whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: <hi>If any man</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>will come after me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 9.23.</note>

                  <p n="9">9. When holy love is more encreaſed: <hi>I love the Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 116.1.</note> 
                     <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath heard my voyce and my ſupplication:</hi> We cannot taſte of the Lord, but we muſt have an hearty love to the Lord: Will you hear the voyce of Experience? this 'tis, <hi>O taſte,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 34.8. Can. 2.5.</note> 
                     <hi>and ſee how good the Lord is;</hi> and then, <hi>O ſtay me with flaggons,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:117624:60"/> and comfort me with Apples, for I am ſick of love;</hi> ſuch a one truly affects Chriſt, and all that follow Chriſt; ſuch a one loves the perſon of Chriſt, without his priviledges; a naked Chriſt, as well as a Chriſt cloathed with all his robes, in all his glory and reſplendent beauty; Chriſt in a Priſon, as well as Chriſt in a Throne: Thus <hi>John</hi> (after all his <hi>Experiences</hi> of Chriſts love to him) could love Chriſt on the croſs, when other forſook him, as well as in the Temple, when he was working miracles.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. When hope is quickened, ſuch times may come, that death and darkneſs may ſurround us, and we may grovel in the duſt: But here is our comfort, <hi>That tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope:</hi> Have we any <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience</hi> of Gods gracious dealings with us in former times?<note place="margin">Rom. 5.4.</note> have we ſometimes been refreſhed by his hand? hath he ſometimes helped us? was he found of us when we ſought him? nay, often unſought for? hath he come to our ſouls, and renewed our ſtock, and filled our becalmed ſpirits with freſh gales of grace? how ſhould we then but hope? <hi>As it was in this</hi> reſpect, <hi>it is, and ever ſhall be;</hi> if new temptations ariſe, and new luſts break in and ſpoil,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.17, 18</note> it is the voyce of <hi>Experience, I was delivered out of the mouth of the Lyon, and the Lord ſhall deliver me from every evil work, and will preſerve me unto his heavenly kingdom, to whom be glory and dominion for ever and ever</hi>—and, <hi>We had the ſentence of death in our ſelves,</hi>

                  <p>IT were good for Chriſtians intending the practical part, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe or the like Rules:
<list>
                        <item>Some Cautionary.</item>
                        <item>Some Directory.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Cautionary Rules may be theſe:—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In gathering <hi>Experiences, Beware of miſpriſion of Gods Providences.</hi> There are many miſtakes now adays, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is our beſt and onely courſe, for our ſecurity, to interpret all Gods works out of his Word: We muſt make the Scriptures [as we ſaid before] a conſtruing book to the book of Gods
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:117624:62"/> Providences: Judge neither better of proſperity, nor worſe of adverſity, then Gods word warrants us. This was the Pſalmiſts cure, his <hi>Experience</hi> put a <hi>Probatum eſt</hi> to this preſcription, <hi>When I thought to know this,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſa. 37.16, 17</note> 
                     <hi>it was too painful for me, until I went into the Sanctuary of God, then underſtood I their end:</hi> God may proſper a wicked man, and he may conſtrue this as an argument, and note it as an <hi>Experience</hi> of Gods gracious dealing with him, and dear love unto him:<note place="margin">Iſa 8.20.</note> O take heed! <hi>To the Law and to the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, if they speak not according to this word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is becauſe there is no light in them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. In improving <hi>Experiences,</hi> beware how we argue from one <hi>Experience</hi> to another: Judgements threatned, are not always inflicted after one and the ſame maner; God meets with the wicked ſometimes in this life, and ſometimes he reſerves their plagues for another. In like maner the gracious Providences of God are not always diſpenſed after one and the ſame maner; indeed <hi>David</hi> could ſay,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 17.36, 37.</note> 
                     <hi>The Lord that delivered me out of the paw of the Lyon, and out of the paw of the Bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philiſtine;</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> could ſay, <hi>I was delivered out of the mouth of the Lyon, and the Lord ſhall deliver me from every evil work:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.17, 18.</note> and ſo we may ſay, that <hi>God many times hath delivered us, and doth deliver us, and therefore that he will deliver us ſtill:</hi> But this maner of arguing, as it is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative, ſo it hath ſome limitations, which we muſt carefully take notice of; as</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That beſides a meer Providence, we take notice of ſome Promiſe of God on which we build: Thus <hi>Paul</hi> delivered from death at one time, argued that God would deliver him at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other time; but in his arguing he eyes the Promiſe, he hangs on God,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.9,10</note> 
                     <hi>which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>raiſeth the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That we conſider the maner of the Promiſe, becauſe</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some Promiſes are disjunctive; as when God in his mercy conveys any thing to us either in particular, or in the equivalent, by way of Commutation and Compenſation with Spiritual things.<note place="margin">Rom 5.4.</note> Thus a Chriſtians <hi>Experience works Hope,</hi> but not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways of the ſelf-ſame outward iſſue, and maner of deliverance out of his trouble, which he hath before time found; No, we muſt <hi>hope</hi> according to the <hi>Word,</hi> or according to the quality of the <hi>Promiſe: Pauls</hi> hope (after <hi>Experience</hi> of many deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances)
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:117624:62"/> was not expreſly or peremptorily, that <hi>the prick in his fleſh ſhould be removed,</hi> but that <hi>Gods grace ſhould be ſufficient,</hi> and ſo he had the fruit of his former <hi>Experience,</hi> becauſe he obtained an equivalent ſupply, but not otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some Promiſes are conditional in reſpect of us; as when God promiſeth protection from contagious ſickneſs, and from trouble, and war: <hi>If my people which are called by my Name,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Chron. 7.14.</note> 
                     <hi>ſhall humble themſelves, and pray, and ſeek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their ſin, and will heal their land.</hi> In theſe or the like Promiſes, God may give us the <hi>Experience</hi> of his Word at one time, but deny it at another, becauſe we fail in the condition of the Promiſe on our parts. Obſerve, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians! would we conclude a deliverance as formerly, be ſure then to look to the frame and diſpoſition of our Spirits: If we are in the way of the Promiſe, then we may conclude it for certain; if we meet God in the courſe of his Providence, or in the improvement of the means he hath appointed, then we may ſet it down, That God will do whatſoever he hath promiſed to give, in his own way, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe not.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some Promiſes are indefinite; as that in <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.14, 15.<note place="margin">Iames 5.14, 15.</note> 
                     <hi>Is any ſick among you? let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him: — and the prayer of faith ſhall ſave the ſick, and the Lord ſhall raiſe him up:</hi> In this caſe God may ſometimes, yet doth not always perform promiſe according to the letter, though a man may be truly qualified with the conditions ſpecified in that Promiſe, <hi>toties quoties,</hi> again and again. It onely intends thus much, That God may, and ſometimes will ſave the ſick, and raiſe him up at the Churches prayers, but he will not ever do ſo. Now as God doth not always perform, ſo neither are we abſolutely, or infallibly, or univerſally to conclude, The Promiſe is not univerſal, but indefinite, and accordingly our concluſions ſhould not be univerſal, but indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite: we ſhould indeed, becauſe of the Promiſe, adventure our ſelves upon God in ſuch a condition, not knowing but in his outward diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations he may make it good to us, yet with ſubmiſſion to his pleaſure, if otherwiſe he diſpoſe of us: And as this is all we muſt do, ſo this is all we can ſay, or conclude in ſuch a caſe as this is.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Directory Rules may be theſe:—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us communicate our own <hi>Experiences</hi> to the good of others. <hi>David</hi> in his deliverances invites others to have recourſe unto him: <hi>Bring my ſoul out of priſon, that I may praiſe thy name;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 142.7.</note> 
                     <hi>then ſhall the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:117624:63"/> righteous compaſs me about, when thou ſhalt deal bountifully with me.</hi> Conceal not within our boſoms thoſe things, the communicating whereof may tend to publike profit: Surely it were a courſe much tending to the quickning of the faith of all, if we would impart to one another our mutual <hi>Experiences.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us trade others <hi>Experiences</hi> to our own particular profit. Thus <hi>David</hi> in deſertion hath recourſe to Gods gracious dealings with his forefathers: <hi>Our fathers truſted in thee, they truſted, and thou didst deliver them; they cryed unto thee, and were delivered, they truſted in thee,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 22.4, 5.</note> 
                     <hi>and were not confounded.</hi> What favor God ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to any one, he will vouchſafe to every one that ſeeketh him dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, if it may be for his good: Thus we finde in Scripture, that ſometimes a perſonal <hi>Experience</hi> was improved to an univerſal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, <hi>James</hi> 5.11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5, 6.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let us caſt our <hi>Experiences</hi> under ſeveral heads, and make the Word and Works face one another, and anſwer one to another: Or to make the work compleat, it were not amiſs to diſtribute the frame into three Columns; and in the firſt to ſet down <hi>Experiences,</hi> in the ſecond the <hi>Texts,</hi> in the third <hi>Diſpoſitions</hi> anſwering Gods minde, in ſuch and ſuch a caſe, to be left on the heart afterwards.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let us pray with fervency (when ever we ſet a time apart to view over our <hi>Experiences</hi>) that thoſe <hi>Diſpoſitions,</hi> anſwering Gods minde in every particular <hi>Experience,</hi> may be written in our hearts, and brought forth in our life afterwards. This will be the chief uſe and choyce comfort of the ſoul in this <hi>Duty.</hi> And this method a poor creature and ſervant of Chriſt hath followed in his own particular practice: whereof I ſhall give you a taſte in the following Section.</p>

We muſt eye the precious promiſes, and yet not ſo as that we muſt cloſe with them, or reſt on them alone, without ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for, or cloſing with Chriſt in thoſe promiſes; the Promiſe is but the Casket, and Chriſt the Jewel in it; the Promiſe is but the field, and Chriſt the Pearl hid in it, and to be chiefly look'd at; the Promiſes are the means by which we are aſſured, not the things on which we are to reſt: It were folly for a man to think he hath an intereſt in an Heireſs Lands, becauſe by ſome means or other he hath got the writings of her Eſtate into his hands; all know that the intereſt of the Lands goes with her perſon, and with relation of marriage to her, otherwiſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a title to her ſelf, all the writings may juſtly be fetched out of his hands again; ſo it is with the <hi>Promiſes,</hi> they hang all upon Chriſt, and without him there is no intereſt to be had in them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt eye the inward graces to which the Promiſes are made, not that we muſt be too much carried away with the ſigns of Chriſt in our hearts, and not after Chriſt himſelf; as
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:117624:73"/> pleaſures that are lawful in themſelves, may be unlawfully uſed, when our thoughts and intentions are too long, or too frequent, or too vehement in them; ſo that to dead the heart either to the preſent delighting in God, or purſuing after him with the joynt ſtrength of our Souls, as our onely chiefeſt good; ſo an immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate recourſe unto ſigns (barely conſidered as ſuch) is as unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, when thereby we are diverted, and taken off from a more conſtant actual exerciſe of daily thoughts of Faith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Chriſt immediately, as he is ſet forth to be our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and yet the mindes of many are ſo wholly taken up with their own hearts, that as the Pſalmiſt ſays of God, <hi>Chriſt is ſcarce in all their thoughts:</hi> Let theſe conſider, what diſhonor this will be to Chriſt, that his train and favorites (our Graces) ſhould have a fuller court, and more frequent attendance from our hearts then himſelf, who is the King of glory: Now to rectifie this error, the way is not wholly to reject all uſes of ſuch <hi>Evidences,</hi> but to order them rightly; as thus,—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let not the uſe of graces go before, but follow after an addreſs of Faith firſt renewed, and acts of Faith firſt put forth upon Chriſt himſelf: Thus whenſoever we would go down into our own hearts, and take a view of our graces, let us be ſure firſt to look wholly out of our ſelves unto Chriſt, as our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to cloſe with him immediately, as if we had no preſent or by-paſt grace to evidence our being in him; and if then (whiles Faith is thus immediately claſping about Chriſt) we finde either preſent or forepaſt graces coming in, as handmaids, to attend and witneſs to the truth of this adherence unto Chriſt, this will derogate nothing from Chriſts honor, or the Doctrine of <hi>Free-grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us in the cloſure of all, begin afreſh to act Faith upon Chriſt immediately, with a redoubled ſtrength; as Faith ſhould give a leading to the uſe of Graces, ſo the ſight of our Graces ſhould be as a back-door to let Faith in again, to converſe with Chriſt: Even as at the Sacrament, the elements of Bread and Wine, are but outward ſigns to bring Chriſt and the heart toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then Faith lets the outward elements go, and cloſeth and treats immediately with Chriſt: So grace is an inward ſign; and whiles men make uſe of it, onely as of a bare ſign to let them come in to Chriſt, and their rejoycing is not in it original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:117624:74"/> but in Chriſt; their confidence is not upon it, but upon Chriſt: There is no danger at all in making ſuch uſe of ſigns; for thus we make our Graces ſubordinate and ſubſervient to Faith, whileſt it makes Chriſt its <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega, The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and the end of all.</hi> I know it is ſtrongly objected againſt Chriſtians, That many forget, and ſeldom uſe an intire, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate cloſe with Chriſt, whileſt in the mean time the ſtream of their moſt conſtant thoughts and deepeſt intentions, are ever running upon their Graces, and the gracious workings thereof in duties towards Chriſt: Others on the contrary run all on Chriſt, deſpiſing the Graces of the Spirit, becauſe (ſay they) <hi>Chriſt is all in all to them;</hi> ſo that if we ask ſuch, Have you any Grace, change of heart? &amp;c. tuſh, what do you tell them of Repentance, Holineſs, &amp;c. they have Chriſt, and that is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; they have the ſubſtance, and what ſhall they now do with ſhadows of Ordinances, Duties, Graces? they have all in Chriſt, what ſhould they look for <hi>Evidences,</hi> from any Graces inherent in themſelves? O let thoſe mourn over themſelves, that have with much affection been ſeeking after Chriſts benefits, peace of conſcience, holineſs of heart and life, but have not ſought firſt and laſt to embrace, and have the perſon of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf; and let ſuch tremble, who in advancing Chriſt himſelf, and <hi>Free-grace,</hi> will needs aboliſh and deſpiſe thoſe heavenly Graces which flow from him unto all the Elect: <hi>The Law of God is written on the heart of Chriſt, Heb.</hi> 10.7.<note place="margin">Heb. 10.7. <hi>with</hi> Pſ. 40 8.</note> and if ever he wraps us up in the Covenant of Grace, <hi>He will write his Law in our hearts alſo, Heb.</hi> 8.10.<note place="margin">Heb. 8.10.</note> The right way for both, is to order their <hi>Evidences</hi> aright, and by this courſe Graces will have their due, and the life of Faith will ſtill be actually maintained and kept upon wing, in its full ure and exerciſe towards Chriſt alone for Juſtification.</p>

                     <hi>MEditation</hi> is a deep and earneſt muſing upon ſome point of Chriſtian inſtruction, to the ſtrengthening of us againſt the fleſh, world and Devil, and to the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us forward towards the Kingdom of Heaven; or <hi>Meditation</hi> is a ſtedfaſt bending of the minde to ſome ſpiritual matter, diſcourſing of it with others, till we bring the ſame to ſome profitable iſſue.</p>
                  <p>Now this Meditation is either ſudden or ſet, occaſional, or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn, and deliberate.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Occaſional</hi> or <hi>Extemporal Meditation,</hi> ariſeth from ſuch things as God by his providence offers to our eyes, ears and ſenſes. <hi>When I conſider the Heavens,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 8.3, 4.</note> 
                     <hi>the work of thy fingers, the Moon and Stars which thou haſt ordained: What is man that thou art mindeful of him, or the ſon of man, that thou viſiteſt him?</hi> This <hi>Meditation</hi> of <hi>Davids</hi> was <hi>occaſional.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Deliberate, ſet,</hi> or <hi>ſolemn Meditation,</hi> ariſeth out of our own hearts, when purpoſely we ſeperate our ſelves from all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and go apart to perform this exerciſe more throughly, making choice of ſuch matter, time and place as are moſt requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite thereunto: Now this <hi>Meditation</hi> is double, for it is either converſant about matters of knowledge, for the finding out of ſome hidden truth, or about matters of affection, for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindling of our love unto God: The former of theſe two we leave to the Schools and Prophets, the latter we ſhall ſearch after, which is both of larger uſe, and ſuch as no Chriſtian can reject, as either unneceſſary, or over-difficult.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. 2.</hi> The Circumſtantials of Meditation.</head>
                  <p>THe circumſtantials of our <hi>Meditation,</hi> are <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place;</hi> I ſhall adde to theſe (though I cannot call it a circumſtance) the <hi>ſubject matter,</hi> which by way of <hi>preparation</hi> to the <hi>duty</hi> we may take notice of.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the time: No time can be preſcribed to all men; for neither is God bound to hours, neither doth the contrary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of men agree in one choice of opportunities; ſome finde their hearts moſt in frame in the morning; others learn wiſdom of their reins in the night ſeaſon; others finde <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s time the fitteſt time, <hi>who went out in the evening to mediate:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 24.63.</note> No practice of others can preſcribe to us in this circumſtance; it is enough that we ſet apart that time wherein we are apteſt for that ſervice.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For place: We judge ſolitarineſs and ſolitary places, fitteſt for <hi>Meditation,</hi> eſpecially for <hi>ſet and ſolitary Meditation:</hi> Thus we found Jeſus meditating alone in the Mount, <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> in the deſert, <hi>David</hi> on his bed, <hi>Daniel</hi> in his houſe, <hi>Iſaac</hi> in the field. <hi>The Bridegroom of our Soul,</hi> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is baſhful (ſaid <hi>Bernard</hi>) and never comes to his meditating Bride in the preſence of a multitude: Hence was the Spouſes invitation, <hi>Come my beloved, let us go forth into the field,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Can. 7.11, 12.</note> 
                     <hi>let us lodge in the villages, let us go up early to the vineyards, let us ſee if the vine flouriſh, whether the tender grapes appear, and the pomegranates put forth, there will I give thee my loves:</hi> We muſt in this caſe abandon worldly ſociety, both outward and inward: Many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſter themſelves from the viſible company of men, which yet carry a world within them; both theſe ſocieties are enemies to this <hi>Meditation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. For the matter of our <hi>Meditation,</hi> it muſt be Divine and Spiritual; <hi>viz.</hi> Gods Word, or ſome part thereof: It is woful to think how ſome meditate on ſin, contrary to Gods Word, ſtudying to go to Hell with the leaſt noiſe of the world; others bend their thoughts onely on the ſearch of natural things; as, The motion of the Heavens, the reaſon of the ebbing and flowing
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:117624:83"/> of the Seas, the kindes of ſimples that grow out of the earth, and the Creatures upon it, with all their qualities and operations; but in the mean while, the God that made them, the vileneſs of their nature, the danger of their ſin, the multitude of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, the Savior that bought them, the Heaven that he bought for them, &amp;c. are as unregarded, as if they were not: The matter of our <hi>Meditation</hi> muſt be ſome thing divine; <hi>I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thee on my bed,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 63 6. and 77.12.</note> 
                     <hi>and meditate on thee: — I will meditate of all thy works, and talk of thy doings.</hi>

                  <p>OCcaſional Meditation ariſeth from ſuch things as God by his providence offers to our eyes, ears or ſenſes: Examples of this ſort are infinite, for a taſte take theſe few:</p>

Upon the ſight of a bright sky full of ſtars, meditate, How worthy a Science it is to ſee and obſerve thoſe goodly ſpangles of light above our heads, their places, qualities, motions: But the imployment of a Chriſtian is far more noble, Heaven is open unto him, and he can look beyond the vail, and ſee further above thoſe ſtars, then it is thither, and there diſcern thoſe glories that may anſwer to ſo rich a pavement: <hi>I ſee indeed thoſe glittering glorious ſtars, with my bodily eyes; but I ſee withall by the eyes of my faith, that this is but the floor of that goodly fabrick, the outward curtain of that glorious tabernable:</hi> I ſee within that incomprehenſible light, which none can ſee and not be bleſſed: How many are theſe ſtars before my eyes? but Oh! what millons of pure and majeſtical Angels? what millions of happy and glorified Souls? how many manſions of my Father (one of them being my own) do I ſee by Faith?

                        <p>There is a twofold <hi>love,</hi> one of <hi>deſire,</hi> which is an earneſt long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after that which we believe would do us much good, if we could attain to it; another of <hi>complacency,</hi> when having at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that which we deſire, we hugge and embrace it, and ſolace our ſelves in the fruition of it: Now the firſt of theſe <hi>loves</hi> is an Introduction to the ſecond, and both of them (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Chriſt) iſſue from a proportionable act of faith prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: 1. That affectionate longing, and thirſty <hi>love,</hi> wherewith we pant and gaſp after Chriſt, proceeds from the firſt acts of faith, whereby we aſſent to all Goſpel-promiſes, as true and good in themſelves, and better unto as then any thing in the world, could we but once be aſſured that they belong unto us. 2.

                           <hi>becauſe the Lord hath dealt bountifully with us;</hi> when ſweetly we repoſe our ſelves in the lap of our Savior, with content
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:117624:85"/> unſpeakable, and ful of glory, it proceeds from the laſt act of faith, wherby we are actual perſwaded by thoſe welcom whiſtlers of the Spirit of adoption, that certainly Chriſt is our Savior, &amp; that our debts are cancelled to the very laſt mite; only obſerve (O my ſoul) theſe two things of this love: 1. That 'tis ſubject to all variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or changes, ebbings and flowings of that perſwaſion; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in a violent temptation, or in a ſenſible deſertion, our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion fails, and ſo this <hi>love of complacency</hi> is either ſtupified, or it falls back into that thirſty auxious <hi>love of deſire.</hi> 2. That this <hi>love of complacency</hi> admits of degrees, proportionable to the degrees of our perſwaſion; if that be clear and ſtrong, this love is more cheerful and pleaſant; if that be weak and obſcure, this love is more cold, with many fears and jealouſies,—<hi>whence this love of complacency</hi> may not unfitly be ſubdivided into an <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and <hi>Heroical love;</hi> ordinary love proceeds from a weak degree of that laſt act of Faith; <hi>Heroical love</hi> ſpringeth from a more eminent and tranſcendent pitch of perſwaſion, concerning our own reconciliation in particular: It is called <hi>Ordinary,</hi> becauſe moſt Chriſtians (though effectually called) do ordinarily feel but ſuch a timerous love in themſelves; it is called <hi>Heroical,</hi> becauſe it is conſtantly onely in ſuch, as either beſides the <hi>evidence</hi> of the Word and Spirit, have had ſome ſpecial revelation to put them out of all doubt, concerning their eſtate to God-ward; or in ſuch as by a certain cloſe walking with God, have been long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in a Chriſtian courſe, have often entertained Chriſt Jeſus at ſupper in their hearts, and habituated themſelves into a more familiar acquaintance with that holy Spirit, which brings all the good news from Heaven, to thoſe diligent ſouls which carefully wait for it.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>In general, that we may live by Faith, we muſt endeavor two things,
<list>
                        <item>1. To get matter for our faith to work upon.</item>
                        <item>2. To order our faith aright in the work.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That we may provide matter for our faith to work upon, we muſt obſerve three things: 1. That we ſtore up all the good promiſes of God, and our own experiences ſeaſonably: It is good to lay up in a good time aforehand.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That we lay in promiſes of all kindes: We had better leave
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:117624:95"/> then lack; it is the wiſdom of a man, that he may not live feebly and poorly, but to have ſomewhat to ſpare.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That we ſo lay them up, that we may have them at hand: It is folly to ſay, <hi>I have good proviſion as can be,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 3.16.</note> 
                     <hi>but I have it not here: Let the word of God dwell in you plenteouſly and richly in all wiſdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That we may order our Faith aright in the work, obſerve theſe Directions:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Take poſſeſſion of the promiſes, and value them as our own.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Expect nothing from the promiſe, but that which is ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the nature of it: To this purpoſe ſome promiſes are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, which God hath ſimply determined to accompliſh; as the promiſe of the Meſſiah, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.14. and of the calling of the Gentiles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26. Some promiſes are conditional, which God will accompliſh in his own order, in his own time, and in his own maner and meaſure; in a word, they are no further promiſed, then God ſeeth in wiſdom to be moſt meet for his glory, and our good; as, all temporal bleſſings, leſs princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Graces, and the meaſure of all ſanctifying Graces: now in all theſe expect nothing from them, but that which is ſuitable to the nature thereof.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That done, then eye that particular good in the promiſe which we ſtand in need of, and ſet Gods power, and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and wiſdom awork, to bring it about; for inſtance, thou art in perſecution, and either thou wouldeſt have deliverance out of it, or comfort and refreſhment in it: In this caſe ſee all this in the promiſe (referring the order, and time, and maner to God) and then ſet Gods power and faithfulneſs awork that can do it, and his wiſdom awork to contrive it, which way he knows beſt: This is the meaning of that Text,<note place="margin">Pſal. 37.5. 1 Pet. 5.7.</note> 
                     <hi>Commit thy ways unto the Lord, truſt in him, and he ſhall bring it to paſs; and hurl your care upon the Lord, for he careth for you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. By faith wait upon God, in that way he hath appointed; it is true, God will work that good for us, yet we muſt uſe the means, and meet God in the courſe of his providence, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we <hi>live not by Faith,</hi> but tempt God, and throw away his promiſes and all.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Set it down and conclude, that God will do whatſoever
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:117624:96"/> he hath promiſed, and we ſhall receive it in the ways of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence: This is the very work of faith it ſelf, thus it draws ſap and vertue from the promiſe, when it concludes, That accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the good in the promiſe, it is ſure to be done.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But imagine the Lord delays, and doth not ſuddenly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh, then muſt faith take up its ſtand, and ſtay till it come: <hi>He that believeth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 28.16.</note> 
                     <hi>maketh not haſte, the viſion is for an appointed time, and therefore wait for it;</hi> ſo the Pſalmiſt, <hi>As the eyes of a ſervant look to the hands of his Maſter, and the eyes of a maiden to her Miſtris, ſo our eyes wait upon the Lord our God, until he have mercy upon us;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 133.2.</note> not <hi>until we will,</hi> or until we ſee it fit, but <hi>until he will have mercy upon us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Imagine the Lord not onely delays, but ſeems to frown, and to ſay, <hi>He will not hear:</hi> In this caſe, labor with an holy humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to contend with our God, and by ſtrong hand to overcome him, for the Lord loves to be overcome thus. When <hi>Jacob</hi> wreſtled with God, <hi>Let me go,</hi> ſaith the Lord; <hi>I will not let thee go,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 32.26.</note> ſaith <hi>Jacob:</hi> So do we catch the Lord Jeſus, and ſtrive with him, and leave him not, till we have thoſe comforts he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and which we have begged: Surely this is the glory and victory,<note place="margin">28.</note> and triumph of faith, when the Lord is fain to lay down his weapons, and to yield himſelf as conquered; <hi>Thy name ſhall be no more called Jacob, but Iſrael, becauſe thou haſt prevailed with God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Two cautions concerning promiſes, and <hi>the life of faith,</hi> are mainly to be obſerved in the general.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That not barely the promiſes, but the perſon of Chriſt, is the object of faith: We are not to wreſt on the promiſes alone, but to cloſe with Chriſt in thoſe promiſes; and therefore in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of, or having recourſe unto a promiſe, we are firſt to ſeek out for Chriſt in it, as being the foundation of it, and ſo to take hold of the promiſe in him: Thus <hi>Philip</hi> directs the Eunuch, <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 6.31.</note> The promiſe is but the Casket, and Chriſt the Jewel in it; the promiſe but the field, Chriſt is the Pearl hid in it, and to be chiefly look'd at: Thus it is ſaid, That promiſes of pardon, are not as pardons of a Prince, which meerly contain an expreſſion of his royal word for pardon; but Gods promiſes are made in his Son, and are as if a Prince ſhould offer to pardon a Traytor, upon marriage with his childe, whom
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:117624:96"/> in and with that pardon he tenders: The reaſon hereof is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt is the grand promiſe, in whom all the promiſes are <hi>Yea and Amen.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.29.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. For Meditation, and the matter of it, conſider theſe things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That faith in this caſe doth ranſack, and fan the ſoul nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly to finde out and remove whatſoever doth offend: <hi>If thou return to the Almighty thou ſhalt be built up,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iob 22.23, 24</note> 
                     <hi>thou ſhalt put ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity far from thy tabernacles: then ſhalt thou lay up gold as duſt, and the gold of Ophir as the ſtones of the brooks.</hi> This advice faith digeſts, and labors the reformation of what is amiſs, and whatſoever hinders the Promiſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That faith is painful, provident and frugal; it ſhakes off idleneſs, takes the opportunity, husbands thriftily, and obſerves Gods providence in all affairs, otherwiſe we <hi>live not by faith,</hi> but tempt God, and throw away his Promiſes and all.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That faith preſerves from the uſe of all unlawful means: The believer conſults ever what is juſt, not what is gainful; or what may be compaſſed by honeſt courſes, not what may be gained by fraud, deceit, cozenage, or the like carnal dealings: <hi>Better is a little with righteouſneſs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov 16.8.</note> 
                     <hi>then great revenues without right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. That faith leans upon the providence of God, who will keep back nothing from us, but what is hurtful and pernicious: Here's a ſweet act of faith, it ſubmits to Gods wiſdom, and reſts on his providence, after the uſe of all lawful means; and this maintains a Chriſtian in ſome meaſure of contentment.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For Prayer, and the parts or maner of it, obſerve this method:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Confeſs our ſins, eſpecially thoſe ſins which upon ſearch we are perſwaded hinders proſperity: <hi>O Lord, I have thought on
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:117624:100"/> my ways, and I finde (this or that) ſin in my boſom, this or that corruption hath gotten head, and hinders thy bleſſings: O Lord, how ſhould I expect needful things? What have I to do with thy Promiſes, that have committed ſuch and ſuch ſins?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Importune the Lord for his Temporal bleſſings, at leaſt ſo far as he ſeeth them to be for our good, and for the glory of his great name: Thus <hi>Bildad</hi> tells <hi>Job,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iob 8.5, 6, 7.</note> 
                     <hi>If thou wouldst ſeek unto God betimes, and make thy ſupplication to the Almighty, ſurely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes prosperous: Though thy beginning was ſmall, yet thy latter end ſhould greatly encreaſe.</hi> Thus <hi>Jabez</hi> prayed,<note place="margin">1 Chro. 4.10.</note> 
                     <hi>O that thou wouldst bleſs me indeed, and inlarge my coaſts,</hi> &amp;c. and God granted him that which he requeſted. In like maner was <hi>Jacobs</hi> prayer, <hi>If God wil be with me, and wil keep me in this way that I go,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 28.20, 21.</note> 
                     <hi>and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, ſo that I come again to my fathers houſe in peace, Then ſhall the Lord be my God:</hi> And thus may we importune the Lord, and make our ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Almighty.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then preſs the Lord with his Promiſes, as with ſo many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Lord, thou haſt ſaid, <hi>Godlineſs hath the promiſe of the life that now is, as well as that which is to come:</hi> Thou haſt ſaid, <hi>Fear the Lord, ye his ſaints, for there is no want to them that fear him,</hi> &amp;c. O theſe are thy Promiſes, make them good to us as it ſtands beſt with thy wiſdom.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the enjoyment of theſe Temporal bleſſings, go we to—
<list>

                           <hi>Meditation.</hi>
                        </item>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. For Meditation, and the matter of it, conſider theſe things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Faith in proſperity, keeps the heart in a holy temper and diſpoſition <hi>(i.)</hi> in humility, meekneſs, tenderneſs and compaſſion towards others, in thankfulneſs, obedience, and in the fear of the Lord: Satan himſelf could reply to the Lord,<note place="margin">Iob 1.10.</note> 
                     <hi>Doth Job fear God for nought? haſt thou not made a hedge about him?</hi> in this caſe faith will remember man of his duty, and perſwade him to be ſo much the more ſerviceable, as Gods mercies are more plentiful upon him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That faith makes a man heavenly-minded in the uſe and poſſeſſion of a proſperous eſtate; as it receives all earthly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:117624:101"/> from God, ſo it windes and pulls up the ſoul to God again: and if it be rightly conſidered, proſperity is the fitteſt ſeaſon for heavenly contemplation; the leſs trouble lies upon our eſtate, the more liberty we have to think of heavenly things: howſoever, faith conſiders theſe things as pledges of Gods love, as parts of our childes-portion, and ſo it makes us look at the better part, thoſe never-fading riches which God hath reſerved in heaven for all that fear him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That faith breeds a godly jealouſie and ſuſpition, leſt the heart ſhould be drawn away with the pleaſing delights of things tranſitory, for by grace it is that we are made conſcious of our own weakneſs, and of the ſnare that is in every creature, to take and intangle us: Proſperity is pleaſing, but dangerous; a man may quickly ſurfet of ſweet meats. This makes the waking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever circumſpect and watchful, and jealous, and ſuſpitious of his own heart, leſt he miſcarry in proſperity, conſidering there is a ſnare in it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That faith mindes a change, even when our mountain ſeems ſtrongeſt:<note place="margin">Iob 3.25.</note> 
                     <hi>The thing I greatly feared</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of, is come unto me;</hi> by this it appears, that <hi>Job</hi> always thought upon a change: <hi>There is no wind</hi> (ſaith the Proverb) <hi>which may not blow rain, if God ſo pleaſe. Riches have their wings,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 23.5. Prov. 27.12.</note> 
                     <hi>and take their flight like an Eagle:</hi> now faith mindes this, and prepares for this; <hi>The prudent man foreſeeth evil, and hideth himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. For Prayer, and the maner of it, obſerve this method:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Confeſs and acknowledge Gods mercy both in his Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and performances: ſay, <hi>Lord, thou haſt promiſed, That no good thing wilt thou withhold from them that walk uprightly; and ſurely thou art true in thy ſayings, I believe by vertue of thy promiſe I enjoy this land, and thoſe goods,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I have nothing, Lord, but meerly of Free-grace, and by vertue of a promiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Pray, importune the Lord for ſanctification of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and for Gods bleſſings upon the means: the more we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper, the more earneſt ſhould the prayers of faith be; for of our ſelves we have no power to wield a good eſtate well, no ability to preſerve or keep it: in greateſt wealth we lie open to many temptations, and if we pray not earneſtly that God may ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie all his Temporal bleſſings to us, we ſhall cool in grace.</p>

                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:117624:101"/>3. Praiſe God for his mercies, and devote our ſelves unto him from whom we have received all: <hi>What ſhall I render unto the Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) for all his mercies towards me?</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. For <hi>Meditation,</hi> and the matter of it, conſider we theſe things,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That of our ſelves we cannot reſiſt theſe ſpiritual evils; all our comfort is, that neither the Devil, nor the world, nor the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:117624:102"/> fleſh, nor ſin, can oppoſe any further then God will give them leave; not the Devil himſelf can tempt who he will, nor when he will, nor how he will, nor how long he will, but in all theſe he is confined by the providence of God. A legion of Devils could not enter into a <hi>Gaderene</hi> Hog, till Chriſt had given them leave: Satan could not touch one bleat pertaining to <hi>Job,</hi> till he had obtained liberty; nor after lay a finger on his body, till his liberty was renewed: O meditate on God and his power, who hath all our enemies in a chain; as for our ſelves, we have no ability to reſiſt any of theſe evils.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That faith fortifies the ſoul againſt all oppoſitions, the more they rage, the more faith heartens the ſoul to believe, and to keep cloſe under the ſhadow of the Lords wings: as the childe affrighted, clings faſter to the mother; ſo the poor ſoul purſued by the Devil, or World, or Fleſh, or Man, or God, or our own Corruptions, it runs to Chriſt, the everlaſting Rock, and in his name reſiſts all theſe evils, and in his name gets the victory.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That in the moſt forcible tempeſts, which God, Devil or Man raiſeth againſt us (when to preſent ſenſe and feeling all ſight and hope of the grace and goodneſs in Chriſt Jeſus is loſt) then faith tells the heart, that a calm is at hand. The laſt temptation wherewith Satan ſet upon Chriſt, was the moſt furious, and when he could not prevail thereby, <hi>he departed for a ſeaſon:</hi> The Lord will not ſuffer us to be tempted above meaſure. This faith aſſures of, and perſwades us quietly to wait for the iſſue.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For prayer, and the maner of it, obſerve this method:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Confeſs our ſins of former ignorance, vanity of minde, ſelf-confidence, ſolitary muſings on the temptations of Satan, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpreting of the Lords doings, &amp;c. which ſet open the ſoul to all other ſpiritual evils:—<hi>O my God, I have diſeſteemed thy mercy, diſtruſted thy promiſes, harbored thoughts of unbelief, &amp;c. and ſo hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:117624:103"/> wounded and broken, I go mourning and deſolate all the day long.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Importune the Lord for pardon of ſin, and for help againſt all oppoſitions: <hi>Pardon, O Lord, my yielding to the temptations of the Devil, or Fleſh, or World, or Man, or Sin: Pardon, O Lord, the infidelity, doubtings, dejectedneſs, infirmities, and carnal exceſſive fears of thy poor ſervant; and for the future, deliver my ſoul from the ſnares, ſtrengthen me in the combate againſt all my enemies: Ariſe, O Lord, diſappoint Satan, caſt him down, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver my ſoul from the wicked one; O be thou my ſtrength in my trouble, for I fly unto thee for help and for ſuccor.</hi>

                     <head>§. An Appendix of the maner of this Life of Faith, in oppoſitions againſt truth and goodneſs, and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly againſt our good Name, whereby an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ſervant of Chriſt ſometimes found abundance of Spiritual comfort.</head>
                     <p>HIs innocency being ſometimes overſhadowed with a thick and dark miſt of Slanders, Reproaches and Defamations, he endeavored firſt to review the Promiſes, and ſecondly to act his faith on them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Promiſes were theſe: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.5, 6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.10, 11, 12. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.13. <hi>Though you have lyen among
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:117624:103"/> the pots, yet ſhall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with ſilver, and her feathers with yellow gold; q.d.</hi> though hitherto you have been as ſo many abjects, caſt into the ends of the earth, as thrown amongſt black and ſmoaky pots, oppreſſed with mighty calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet the time is at hand that ye ſhall be made white as doves; your innocency and happineſs ſhall appear, and your white ſhall be intermixt with the colour of pure and yellow gold; <hi>(i.)</hi> you ſhall come to the top of the higheſt felicity, and ye ſhall be freed from ſlanders, and obtain illuſtrious glory.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In the acting of his faith, he endeavored 1. To Meditate: 2. To pray.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. His Meditations were theſe:—</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That we know not how to prevent it. Men may ſlander, and men will ſlander, ſo long as the world laſts; onely we have theſe Promiſes for comforts, and it is the Lord who promiſeth, and if he pleaſe, he can hide us from the ſcourge of tongues;<note place="margin">Iob 5.21. Iſa. 61.7.</note> or if he pleaſe, he is able to reſtore us double to our ſhame.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That true faith will fortifie the ſoul againſt all Reproaches: There is an encouraging voyce of the Lord to this end;<note place="margin">Iſa. 51.7.</note> 
                        <hi>Hearken unto me, ye that know righteouſneſs; the people in whoſe heart is my law: fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. That if the wicked reproach more and more, yet it is the duty of Chriſtians to exerciſe patience. Experience of their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and Gods gracious dealings with us, will fortifie our hearts: <hi>Fear not thou worm</hi> (thou poor deſpicable thing) <hi>I will help thee,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 41.14.</note> 
                        <hi>ſaith the Lord thy Redeemer;</hi> and as for thy reproachers, their doom is before, <hi>Behold, all they that are incenſed againſt thee,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">11.</note> 
                        <hi>ſhall be aſhamed and confounded; they ſhall be as nothing, and they that ſtrive with thee ſhall periſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. That faith makes the ſoul circumſpect, and in this caſe doth ranſack and fan the ſoul narrowly, to finde out what is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and riſe of thoſe ſlanders &amp; reproaches:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.14.</note> 
                        <hi>If ye ſuffer for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſake, happy are ye;</hi> it muſt be for righteouſneſs ſake, or there is no bleſſing upon it: and ſo the Apoſtle addes,<note place="margin">16.</note> 
                        <hi>You muſt have a good conſcience, that whereas they ſpeak evil of you as of evil doers, they may be aſhamed that falſly accuſe your good converſation in Chriſt: for it is better, if the will of God be ſo,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">17.</note> 
                        <hi>that ye ſuffer for well-doing, then for evil-doing.</hi> We are ordinarily more impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:117624:104"/> at undeſerved, then deſerved ſufferings; but it is better (ſaith the Apoſtle) ſo to ſuffer,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.15, 16</note> then otherwiſe. <hi>Let none of you ſuffer as a murtherer, a thief, an evil door, but if any man ſuffer as a Chriſtian, let him not be aſhamed, but let him glorifie God on this behalf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. That true faith eſteems all ſuch ſlanders as the moſt honorable badges of innocency that poſſibly can be. <hi>If mine adverſary ſhould write a b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <note place="margin">Iob 31.35, 36</note> 
                        <hi>ſurely I would take it upon my ſhoulder, and binde it as a crown to me. I rejoyce</hi> (ſaid <hi>Luther) that Satan ſo rages and blaſphemes, it is likely that I do him and his Kingdom the more miſchief. And they that reproach me</hi> (ſaid <hi>Auſtin) do againſt their wills increaſe mine honor both with God and good men.</hi> The more the dirty feet of men tread and rub on the figure graven in gold, the more luſtre they give it: ſo the more cauſleſs aſperſions the wicked caſt on the godly, the more bright do they rub their glory. And hence was that choyce of <hi>Moſes, rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 11.25, 26.</note> 
                        <hi>then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon: eſteeming the reproach of Chriſt greater riches then the treaſures of Egypt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. For Prayer, his method was,—</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To complain to the Lord, as ſometimes <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Thou, O Lord,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 69.19.20.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. To petition to the Lord, as otherwhiles <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Let me not be aſhamed,</hi>

                        <note place="margin">20.</note> 
                        <hi>thou ſhalt keep them ſecretly in a pavilion from the ſtrife of tongues.</hi> Thus Lord I beg at thy hands, or if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 16.11, 12.</note> thou knoweſt it beſt in thy wiſdom: <hi>Let them alone, and let them curſe, it may be the Lord will look on my affliction, and thou Lord wilt requite good for their curſing this day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. To preſs the Lord with his gracious Promiſes: as thus, Thou haſt ſaid,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.11.</note>

                     <p n="4">4. To pray to the Lord to forgive all his Enemies that treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed againſt him, as ſometimes Chriſt did, <hi>Father, forgive them,</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. Faith in theſe promiſes doth greatly inlarge the heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and ſtirreth up to earneſt ſtudy of holineſs; if a Chriſtian be much in the Meditation of Gods ſingular goodneſs in Chriſt, it will even conſtrain him to yield up himſelf wholly to God,<note place="margin">Pſal 26.2, 3.</note> in all manner of godly converſation: <hi>Examine, O Lord, and prove me, try my reins and my heart, for thy loving kindeneſs is before mine eyes, and I have walked in thy truth.</hi>

                  <p n="5">5.

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. For Meditation, and the matter of it, conſider theſe things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That of our ſelves we have no ability to attain any of theſe Graces: Every one can ſay, <hi>I purpoſe well,</hi> but the queſtion is, whether they build not on their own ſtrength: Many a man (eſpecially in time of his ſickneſs, danger, diſgrace) will make fair promiſes of amendment, but when the rod is removed, all is forgotten: What may be the reaſon? he ſtands on his own feet, he preſumes to go alone of himſelf, and by his own ſtrength, and then no marvel if he falls and catcheth many a knock: If we will have any of theſe <hi>Graces,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 119 8.</note> then deny we our ſelves: <hi>I will keep thy ſtatutes</hi> (ſaid <hi>David</hi>) but immediately upon his reſolution he cries, <hi>O forſake me not utterly:</hi> Purpoſes thus grounded, bring forth holy performances, but of our ſelves we can expect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Gods Spirit will infuſe theſe <hi>Graces,</hi> and the increaſe of theſe <hi>Graces</hi> into them that believe: Many would fain have Knowledge, and Faith, and Hope, and Joy, &amp;c. but they exerciſe not their Faith to believe God and his promiſes:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.2.</note> 
                     <hi>I knew a man in Chriſt</hi> (could <hi>Paul</hi> ſay) concerning his Revelation; ſo, <hi>I know a man in Christ off and on, unstayed, diſmayed at his manifold ſlips, strong corruptions, little prevailings against them,</hi> and (when all came to all) he could finde no help till he went to a promiſe, and by faith believed that God would ayd and aſſiſt, and do the whole work for him; it is good to believe that (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promiſe) God will ſanctifie our natures, inable us to holineſs, and beſtow all his graces on us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That for the degrees of theſe Graces, it is neceſſary to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them; graces improved, are the ready way to have them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed:
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:117624:108"/> God ever beſtows the greateſt meaſure, where he findes a care to put them forth to advantage: <hi>Whoſoever hath,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 13.12.</note> 
                     <hi>to him ſhall be given, and he ſhall have more abundance;</hi> as men increaſe their ſubſtance by labor, and learning by diligence, ſo he that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves graces, ſhall more and more abound in them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For Prayer, and the parts of it, obſerve this method:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Confeſs and acknowledge our inabilities: <hi>O Lord, I have no grace by nature, I have no power to cleanſe my own heart: O Lord, I have defaced thine image, but I cannot repair it;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7.21.</note> 
                     <hi>I may ſay with the Apoſtle, When I would do well, evil is preſent with me, but I finde no means to perfect what I deſire: I am not able to crawl about the doing of that which is good: O when ſhall I be ſet at liberty, that I might do the work of God, and run the race of his Commandments: O that I had Knowledge, and Faith, and Hope, and Joy, and Love!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Look we up to the Power, and Grace, and Truth of God, and preſs him therewith: <hi>Lord, I have heard of thy power, thou art God Almighty, who calleſt the things that are not, as if they were; thou canſt if thou wilt, work in me theſe Graces, and create them in me, as thou didſt gloriouſly create them in</hi> Adam, <hi>the firſt man: Lord, I have heard alſo of thy grace and truth, thou art as faithful to keep, as free to make theſe ſweet precious promiſes; Thy grace is unſearchable, thy word purer then ſilver ſeven times refined: O then make good thy promiſes, I preſs thee with thy Power, Grace and Truth: O repleniſh me with thy Graces, give me Knowledge, and Faith, and Hope, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Look we on the promiſes, and pray by them, or turn them into prayers: Faith hearkeneth what the Lord ſpeaketh, and ſpeaketh back again in fervent groans and deſires to whatſoever it hearkeneth: Hence we can make no prayer in boldneſs, faith or comfort, but for things promiſed, and in that maner as they are promiſed. Thus <hi>Jacob (Gen.</hi> 32.9.<note place="margin">Gen. 32.9.</note>) and <hi>David</hi> (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.27, 28, 29.<note place="margin">2 Sam 7.27, 28, 29.</note>) prayed <hi>by a promiſe;</hi> and thus ſhould we pray <hi>by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> and then we may be ſure we pray according to his will. In want of other Rhetorick and Oratory, let us urge God with this repetition: <hi>Lord, thou haſt promiſed, Lord, thou haſt promiſed, thou hast made many ſweet precious promiſes of Graces, and of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Graces: Thou haſt ſaid,</hi>

That faith ſtrives to enter into the poſſeſſion of this Kingdom by degrees: Men that purchaſe an inheritance to come in here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, they are glad if any part fall into their hands for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: Fulneſs of glory is reſerved for the life to come, but the beginnings of glory (as peace of Conſcience, joy in the Holy Ghoſt, Sanctification of the Spirit) are vouchſafed here; grace if the beginning of glory, and glory is the perfection of grace; now as grace grows, ſo we enter upon the poſſeſſion of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance: Hence lively grace covets grace more and more, that we may get Heaven by degrees, and by parcels.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Duties they muſt perform to them, are—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To provide that they may live under the publike Miniſtery, for otherwiſe how ſhould they be brought into the ſheepfold of Chriſt, if they hear not the voyce of the chief Shepherd ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto them by thoſe whom he hath ſent?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To overſee the ways of their Families, that they ſerve
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:117624:115"/> God; and as in all other duties, ſo eſpecially in ſanctifying the Sabbaths: To this the very words in the fourth Commandment, do binde all Maſters of <hi>families: Remember, thou and thy ſon, and thy daughter, thy man-ſervant, and thy maid;</hi>—Where the Lord ſpeaks by name to the Governors, as if he would make them overſeers of this work of ſanctifying his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To ſet their houſe in order for the ſervice of God, to offer prayers and praiſes to the Lord morning and evening, before and after meals:<note place="margin">Pſal 55.17.</note> This was <hi>Davids</hi> practice, <hi>Evening and morning, and at noon will I pray and cry aloud, and he ſhall hear my voyce;</hi> and this was <hi>Jobs</hi> practice,<note place="margin">Iob 1.5.</note> who ſent for, and ſanctified his ſons and daughters, <hi>and roſe up early in the morning, and offered burnt-offerings, according to the number of them all:—Thus did Job continually:</hi> And this was <hi>Abrahams</hi> practice whereſoever he came,<note place="margin">Gen. 12.7. &amp; 13.4. &amp; 21.33.</note> 
                     <hi>to build an Altar to God,</hi> where God ſhould be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped joyntly of him and his family: And this was Chriſts practice for <hi>himſelf and his family, Matthew</hi> 14.19. and 26.30. <hi>John</hi> 17.1.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To inſtruct their families privately in matters of Religion, that they may not onely profeſs, but feel the power of Religion in their lives and converſations: This duty hath theſe ſpecials be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A familiar catechizing of them in the principles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:<note place="margin">Deut 6.7.</note> Thus were Parents commanded of old, <hi>Thou ſhalt teach theſe words diligently unto thy children, and ſhalt talk of them when thou ſitteſt in thine houſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov 22.6.</note> 
                     <hi>and when thou walkeſt by the way, and when thou lieſt down, and when thou riſeſt up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. A daily reading of Scriptures in their hearing, directing them to mark and to make uſe of them: So <hi>Timothy</hi> was train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by his parents,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.15.</note> and that <hi>from his childehood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. A careful endeavoring that they may profit by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Miniſtery: To this end 1. They muſt prepare them to hear the Word, by conſidering Gods Ordinances, Promiſes, and their own neceſſities. 2. They muſt remember them to look in the Word for a Chriſt, and for communion with Chriſt. 3. They muſt examine them after the Ordinances, what they have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and what uſe they can make of it; thus Chriſt, after he had preached a parable to his diſciples, he ſaid unto them, <hi>Know
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:117624:115"/> you not this parable, and how then will you know all parables?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mark 4.13.</note> and then he expounds the parable to them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The duties they are to require of the family, are both carefully to frequent the publike Miniſtery, and diligently to be converſant in the private worſhip of God, and conſtantly to practice all holy and Chriſtian duties compriſed briefly in the Commandments of God; and they are to require theſe things, not onely by telling them, calling on them, catechizing them, admoniſhing them, but if they be negligent, by correcting them.</p>
                  <p>Now this correction muſt be miniſtred in

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. In wiſdom, whoſe property it is to finde out the right party that committed the fault, to conſider of what ſort and nature the fault is, to weigh circumſtances of age, diſcretion and occaſions; and to look to the minde of the doer, whether neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence or meer ſimplicity brought him to it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In patience, whoſe property it is to make the fault mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to the offendor, that his conſcience may be touched there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; to hear what the offendor can ſay in his own defence, and accordingly to allow or diſſallow; to avoid bitterneſs, which ſooner will harden the heart, then reform the maners of the offendor: Theſe Rules being obſerved, and the heart lifted up in prayer to God for direction and bleſſing, this <hi>Correction</hi> is neceſſary, as is evident in <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.2. <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.24. and 19.18.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the duties that <hi>Governors</hi> owe to their <hi>families,</hi> in reſpect of their ſouls; <hi>to correct them, catechize them, admoniſh them, call on them, read to them, pray for them, &amp;c.</hi> onely with theſe limitations:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That they preſume not above their callings: This was <hi>Pauls</hi> Exhortation, <hi>That no man take this honor to himſelf, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron:</hi> The <hi>honor</hi> here,<note place="margin">Heb. 5.4.</note> is the <hi>honor</hi> of the publike Miniſtery, except that, and I know not but that every Governor of a family, who hath ſpecial abilities, utterance, memory, may read Scriptures, repeat Sermons, pray, teach and inſtruct them out of Scriptures, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10.<note place="margin">Gen. 35.2.</note> Thus <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid to his houſhold, <hi>Put away the ſtrange gods that are among you:</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That they preſume not above their gifts: This was <hi>Pauls</hi> Exhortation to every man,<note place="margin">Rom 12.3.</note> 
                     <hi>Not to think of himſelf more highly then he ought to think, but to think ſoberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the meaſure of faith;</hi> yet I deny not but in ſome caſes they may lawfully depute or ſubſtitute ſome one in the family, whom they judge fitteſt unto the ſervice and imployment, which they themſelves ſhould ordinarily perform, as in caſe of old age and weakneſs of body;<note place="margin">1 Sam. 8.1.</note>

To this purpoſe ſhe is called, <hi>The wife of his boſom,</hi> to ſhew that ſhe ought to be as his <hi>heart</hi> in his boſom. He muſt love her at all times, he muſt love her in all things: love muſt ſeaſon and ſweeten his ſpeech, carriage, actions towards her: love muſt ſhew it ſelf in his commands, reproofs, admonitions, inſtructions, authority, familiarity with her; the riſe of which love muſt not be from her beauty, nobility, or becauſe ſhe contents &amp; pleaſeth her husband; but eſpecially becauſe ſhe is his ſiſter in the profeſſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, and an inheriter with him of the Kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; becauſe of her graces, and vertues, as modeſty, chaſtity, diligence, patience, temperance, faithfulneſs, ſecrecy, obedience, &amp;c. becauſe ſhe bears and brings him forth children, the heirs of his Name and Subſtance, and the upholder of his family; and becauſe of the union and conjunction of marriage.

                     <hi>He ſet his love on you, becauſe he loved you;</hi> his love aroſe wholly and ſolely from himſelf, and was every way free: ſo ſhould husbands love their wives, though there be nothing in wives to move them, but meerly becauſe they are wives.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the order of his love: Chriſt began it to the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church could love him: and as a wall is firſt ſmitten on by the Sun beams, before it give a reflection of her heat back again; ſo the Church is firſt heated and warmed at heart by the ſenſe of Chriſts love, before ſhe love him again: <hi>We love him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Iohn 4.19. Cant. 1.2.</note> 
                     <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he loved us firſt:—Becauſe of the ſavour of thy oyntments, therefore do the virgins love thee;</hi> ſo ſhould husbands begin to love their own wives: I know ſome wives prevent their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands herein, and there may be reaſon for it; but the greater is
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:117624:120"/> their glory. This patern of Chriſt ſhould rather ſtir up the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands to go before them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the truth of Chriſts love: This was manifeſted by the fruits thereof to his Church;<note place="margin">Eph. 5.25, 16, 27.</note> 
                     <hi>He gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctifie it, and cleanſe it, and preſent it to himſelf a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Church, not having ſpot or wrinckle:</hi> So muſt husbands love their wives in truth and in deed, by guiding them in the way of life, and path that is called <hi>Holy:</hi> for this is the trueſt character of a ſincere love.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In the quality of his love: Chriſts love is an holy, pure, and chaſte love: as he himſelf is, ſo is his love, ſuch muſt be the love of husbands, an holy, pure and chaſte love. Away with all intemperate, exceſſive, or any ways exorbitant pollutions of the marriage-bed! from which, if the fear of God, imitation of Chriſt, love of purity, awfulneſs of Gods all-ſeeing eye cannot draw, yet that ſlaviſh horror, leſt God ſhould puniſh ſuch a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with no children, or with miſ-ſhapen children, or with idiots, or with prodigiouſly wicked children, or with ſome other heavy croſs, one would think ſhould be able to affright them.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Iohn 13.1.</note>5. In the continuance of Chriſts love: <hi>Having loved his own, he loved them unto the end.</hi> His love is a conſtant love, an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting love: no provocation or tranſgreſſions could ever make him forget his love;<note place="margin">Ier. 3.1.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou haſt played the harlot with many lovers, yet return unto me.</hi> Such muſt be the love of husbands, a firm love, an inviolable love: the ground of it muſt be Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and the ſupport of it muſt be an inviolable reſolution, that no provocation ſhall ever change it, or alter it. Husbands muſt paſs by all infirmities, endeavoring in love to redreſs them, if poſſibly they can, or if not, to bear with them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Duty of an husband, is, <hi>Wiſely to maintain and manage his authority:</hi> Now the managing of it conſiſts in two things:
<list>
                        <item>1. That he tenderly reſpect her.</item>
                        <item>2. That he carefully provide for her.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. He muſt <hi>tenderly respect her,</hi> as his wife, companion, yoke-fellow,<note place="margin">Ezek. 24.16.</note> as his very delight, and the <hi>deſire of his eyes,</hi> and <hi>never be bitter againſt her.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 3.19.</note> This bitterneſs ordinarily turneth the edge of his authority: if therefore any matter of unkindeneſs ariſe (as ſometimes certainly will) then muſt he carefully, with all lenity, gentleneſs and patience quiet all, and never ſuffer himſelf nor his
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:117624:120"/> wife to ſleep in diſpleaſure:<note place="margin">Eph 4.26.</note> 
                     <hi>Let not the ſun go down upon your wrath;</hi> or if he ſhall have occaſion to reprove her, he muſt keep his words until a convenient time, &amp; not do it in preſence of others, and then utter them in the ſpirit of meekneſs and love. Surely if ſhe be not corrected by a word of wiſdom and diſcretion, ſhe will never amend by threats, or any haſty, rigorous carriage: and if ſhe once begin to loſe her ſhamefac'dneſs in the preſence of her husband, it is likely there will be often brawlings and quarrels betwixt them, and the houſe will be full of diſquietneſs: it is beſt therefore to deal wiſely with her, to admoniſh her often, to reprehend her ſeldom, never to lay violent hands on her; and if ſhe be dutiful, to cheriſh her, that ſhe may ſo continue; if wayward, mildely to ſuffer her, that ſhe wax not worſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He muſt carefully provide for her: To this purpoſe he is called her Head, and Savior, as <hi>Chriſt is the head of his Church,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 5 23.</note> and the Savior of the body: The <hi>Head</hi> (you know) is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of motion, quickning, life, ſenſe and lightſomneſs to the body; ſo ſhould the husband be as the well-ſpring of livelineſs, light-ſomneſs, light-heartedneſs to his wife: ſhe hath forſook all for him, and therefore ſhe ſhould receive from him a continual influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of chearful walking, and comfortable enjoying of her ſelf. And a <hi>Savior</hi> (you know) both provides for, and protects the ſaved: Chriſt thus ſaved his Church, he is every way a ſufficient Savior, <hi>able perfectly to ſave, even to the very uttermoſt;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 7.25.</note> he ſaves ſoul and body, he ſaves from all maner of miſery, from the wrath of God, the curſe of the Law, the venom of all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward croſſes, the tyranny of Satan, the ſting of death, the power of the grave, the torments of hell, or if ſin be the greateſt evil, (as indeed it is) <hi>he will ſave his people from their ſins:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 1.21.</note> I cannot ſay thus of the husband; yet an husband carrieth a reſemblance of Chriſt, and is after a maner a Savior to his wife, to protect her, and provide for her. <hi>David</hi> compares her to <hi>a vine,</hi>

At laſt by extraordinary expence, and exceſſive charges about him, ſhe came to ſome want of ſome neceſſaries, whereupon ſhe ſold her Ring, Chains, richeſt Attire, Plate, and choyceſt Jewels: and when he was dead, and friends came about her, rather to congratulate her happy riddance, then to bewail her widowhood, ſhe not onely abhorred all ſpeeches tending that way, but proteſted, if it were poſſible, ſhe would willingly redeem her husbands life with the loſs of her five dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt children.

Hence the <hi>fear</hi> of a childe, is oppoſed to the <hi>fear</hi> of a ſlave; for a childes <hi>fear</hi> being mixt with <hi>love,</hi> hath reſpect to the offence which a parent may take: but a ſlaves <hi>fear,</hi> which is ordinarily mixed with hatred, hath reſpect to nothing but the puniſhment which his Maſter may inflict upon him. This <hi>love-like-fear</hi> is ſo proper to children, as that the awful reſpect which the Saints bear to God, is called <hi>a filial fear:</hi> Children have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their ſubſtance, from the very ſubſtance of their parents, and therefore they are to perform this <hi>Duty</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> to them.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. How far they muſt obey; or what is the extent of ſervants obedience to Maſters?<note place="margin">Col. 3.22.</note>— The Apoſtle anſwers, <hi>Servants, obey in all things your maſters according to the fleſh:</hi> It is not ſufficient that ſervants perform well their <hi>Duties</hi> in ſome things; they muſt do it in <hi>all things,</hi> yea in things that may be againſt their own minde and liking, if their Maſters will have it ſo: This is clear in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Joab, the King commands him to number the people; Joab</hi> declares himſelf,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24 2, &amp;c.</note> that he thinks it a very unmeet thing, <hi>Why doth my Lord the King delight</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in this thing?</hi> yet againſt his judgement he yields unto the Kings peremptory command, <hi>The Kings word prevailed againſt Joab.</hi> Look as <hi>Peter,</hi> when Chriſt bid him lanch out into the deep, and let down his net for a draught,<note place="margin">Luke 5.4, 5.</note> 
                     <hi>He anſwered and ſaid, Maſter, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheleſs, at thy word I will let down the net.</hi> So muſt ſervants ſay, when they have a perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry command, though contrary to their own judgements, this or that in all humility, I ſuppoſe, or I propound to you, <hi>Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, at your word I will let down the net,</hi> I will do as you pleaſe.</p>

                     <hi>They feared God</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>and did not as the King commanded them.</hi> In this caſe <hi>Joſeph</hi> is commended in not hearkning to his Miſtris; and the ſervants of <hi>Saul</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, for refuſing to ſlay the Lords Prieſts at their Maſters command.

                     <hi>We ought to obey God rather then men.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. Humility: Humble men contend not, cenſure not, quarrel not, diſdain not: They can meet with unequal reſpects of age, ſex, ſtate and parts; they can diſcern even in women what is to be honored, and if there be not always ſo profound a judgement, yet many times there is more holy, and more ſweet affections: They have not the faith of Chriſt in reſpect of perſons, but can ſay to the poor man (if he be of the poor whom God hath choſen, rich in Grace, and heir of the Kingdom) <hi>Sit thou here in a good place;</hi> they can prefer Grace before parts, and delight in the ſweet ſcent of creeping Violets: They can make uſe of, and improve all other mens gifts,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.10.</note> 
                     <hi>For in honor they prefer one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and ſo they come to be kindely affectioned one to another in brotherly love; they can ſpy out Graces of all ſorts, in all ſorts and ranks of people: They obſerve the ſweet affability and courteſie of ſome great ones, the honeſt diligence and patience of ſome poor ones, the bluſhing modeſty and humility of ſome ſolidly learned, the chearful activity of Gods worſhip of ſome illiterate, that love Chriſt in ſincerity, though they cannot diſpute for him: Several ſorts of men, have ſeveral luſtres: now the humble learn of all, and ſo receive much benefit in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion from all: This Grace then gives him a fitneſs for this Society.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Acknowledgement, and the priſing of others gifts: It is ſaid of <hi>Apollos,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts. 18.24.25.</note> 
                     <hi>That though he were an eloquent man, and mighty in the Scriptures, yet he ſo far acknowledged and honored the Graces of God, and the gifts that were in</hi> Aquila <hi>and</hi> Priſcilla, (a plain couple, an handy-crafts man and his wife) <hi>that he was content to learn of them:</hi> O let not Brethren envy and grudge at one another, but acknowledge and prize the gifts of others as their own gifts.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 2 4.</note>3. Self-denial: <hi>Let nothing be done through ſtrife or vain-glory,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:117624:125"/> but in lowlineſs of minde, let each eſteem other better then themſelves: Look not every man on his own things, but every man alſo on the things of others:</hi> How goodly is it to ſee a man who hath parts, and gifts, and graces, to deny himſelf, and all for the edifying of the body? <hi>Paul</hi> could endeavor to pleaſe all men in all things, <hi>Not ſeeking his own profit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.33.</note> 
                     <hi>but the profit of many:</hi> He hath a true publique ſpirit, that prefers the body of Chriſt, before his own private; that can deny himſelf, ſo that God may be glorified.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Love: A grace of ſuch uſe and influence, that without love there can be no <hi>Christian Society;</hi> it is love that joyns hands and hearts: So the ſoul of <hi>Jonathan</hi> was knit to the ſoul of <hi>David, For Jonathan loved him as his own ſoul.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. 18.1.</note> 
                     <hi>Love</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth men to all ſpiritual Offices, to pray together, ſing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, talk or confer together; on the contrary, all the gifts in the world, how excellent ſoever, are nothing worth without love: <hi>Though I ſpake with the tongues of men and Angels;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.1, 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Though I had the gifts of all propheſie, and underſtood all myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and all knowledge, and have not love, I am nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Amiableneſs, Facility or Condeſcention: Rugged ſtones unhewn and unſquared, cannot fitly lie and joyn together in one building; ſowre, harſh and ſullen ſpirits, are not fit for ſociety: If there be a <hi>Nabal,</hi> who is ſuch a ſon of <hi>Belial,</hi> that no man can ſpeak to him, he may not be entertained: I know there are ſome good men of an harſh and ridgid diſpoſition, who make many a poor Chriſtian to ſtartle back, though he came with a reſolution to conſult and learn ſomething of them: But there is in ſome others (whom I always prefer) an alluring facility, that doth call in the modeſt and bluſhing, who would otherwiſe ſtep back: Now this ſweet diſpoſition for gaining of ſouls into the liking and reliſhing of the good ways of God, is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable Grace.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Sobriety of ſpirit, in the ſuſpending of all raſhneſs of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and a patient bearing with ſome errors and offences, which unavoidably wil ſometimes fall out: The Apoſtle had reſpect unto this, when he admoniſhed the <hi>Coloſſians, To forbear one another,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Coloſſ. 3.13.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp; to forgive one another, if any man have a quarrel againſt any, or a matter of complaint</hi> (as the word ſignifieth) <hi>even as Chriſt forgave you:</hi> How quarrellous are ſome men? How loud and ſhrill, and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:117624:126"/> thunder-ſtormy in their complaints? on the contrary, heavenly ſouls reſolve to do good, and to ſuffer evil: Such was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> carriage towards <hi>Shimei,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Sam. 16.7, 10.</note> and <hi>Shimei</hi> curſed him: <hi>Come out thou bloody man, thou man of Belial: David</hi> ſaid no more, but <hi>Let him curſe, becauſe the Lord had ſaid unto him, Curſe David.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Innocency, harmleſneſs, or inoffenſiveneſs of converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Nothing more deſtroys <hi>Christian-Society,</hi> then frequent lyes, flatteries, whiſpering, ſcoffs, calumnies, and invented ſlanders:<note place="margin">Iames 3.8.—1.26.</note> Hence <hi>James</hi> calls the tongue, <hi>An unruly evil, full of deadly poiſon;— And if this member be not tamed, all Religion is in vain;</hi> and conſequently all Religious Society.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. An holy coveting of excellent gifts: Emulation ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engenders ſtrife, and overthrows <hi>Chriſtian-Society;</hi> But this holy contention, this ſpiritual emulation, this zeal after more perfection of gifts and graces,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.31.</note> the Apoſtle enjoyneth, <hi>Covet earneſtly the beſt gifts; q.d.</hi> affect, emulate, be zealous after a further growth or improvement.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Wiſdom: Both to diſcern where the rich treaſure lies, and to be able to draw it forth: There lies many times a great deal of ſpiritual wealth, in ſome obſcure and neglected Chriſtians, which many ſupercilious and conceited profeſſors do paſs by and neglect: One would not think what dexterity in Scriptures, what judgement in Controverſies, what fervency and expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Prayer, what acquaintance with God and his Providence, what ſtrength of Faith, what Patience, Meekneſs, Moderation, Contentedneſs, Heavenly-mindedneſs, may be now and then found out and diſcovered in plain people, that have plain carriage and plain ſpeech: Here then is the neceſſary uſe of wiſdom, to diſcover thoſe gifts and graces; and when we finde ſuch a vein, to dig it, and draw it forth: Do you obſerve one of great dexterity in Scriptures? propound to him ſome difficult place where you were fain to make a ſtand: Do you obſerve one well ſtudied in controverſies? deſire him to untie a knot, where you have been a great while looking for an end: Do you obſerve one acquainted with caſes of deſertion and ſoul-clouds? learn of him what experiments he hath collected, and which was his way out of the miſt: Do you obſerve one powerful in Prayer? get him to commend your ſuits with you unto God: All men would
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:117624:126"/> be dealt with in the proper way wherein they are verſed, and wherein they excel.</p>

                  <p n="1">1.

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. To the bodies of one another: The primitive Chriſtians excelled in this care, they put their eſtates (by reaſon of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution) into <hi>a common ſtock,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 4.32. &amp; 34.35.</note> that all, even the pooreſt ſort, that in thoſe hard and uncertain times, gave their names to Chriſtianity, might be tended and looked on with equal care and reſpect: I know ſome have ſtretched this too far, to make
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:117624:127"/> it a leading caſe and binding example; but thus far it holds, that if the neceſſity of the faithful call for it, even all that we have muſt be ſerviceable in order and in due reſpects: The Catalogue runs thus; 1. The publike ſtate wherein we live, we muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for. 2. Our ſelves. 3. Our wives. 4. Our parents. 5. Our children and family. 6. The houſhold of faith. 7. Our kindred. 8.

It is truly an acceptable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to God, and a glorious Miniſtery, to tend the Lords poor and ſick; therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſometimes took upon him the <hi>fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the miniſtring to the Saints,</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. To the ſouls of one another, and this ſeveral ways:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In watching over one another: I know we have Enemies that maliciouſly watch over us for our haltings, but it is the part of a friend, to watch over his companion for good; we are apt enough to neglect our own watch, we had need to have either prying enemies, or faithful friends, to make us know our ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In admoniſhing and reproving thoſe that fall: This is a great Duty, but much neglected. Reverend Mr. <hi>Bolton,</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that grave and religious Judge <hi>Nichols</hi> (who deſired him ſometimes to deal plainly with him) confeſſed after the Judges death,<note place="margin">Boltons quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tior noviſſima, pag. <hi>163.</hi>
                     </note> that <hi>he was grieved at his heart that he had done no more in that kinde:</hi> O count not admonition an unneceſſary medling, we may through a fooliſh humor to be eſteemed peaceable and quiet, ſuffer many to miſcarry and be loſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In recovering thoſe that are fallen, through a ſpirit of meekneſs: <hi>Brethren, if any man be overtaken with a fault, ye which are spiritual, reſtore ſuch a one in the spirit of meekneſs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 6.1, 2.</note> 
                     <hi>conſidering thy ſelf, leſt thou alſo be tempted.</hi> Chriſtians ſhould not triumph over them that are on the ground, and thrown down by a temptation, but rather they ſhould ſit by them on the ſame flat, and mourn with them and for them, and feel ſome of their weight.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In inſtructing the ignorant, dull, and leſs capable: To this purpoſe we ſhould rather keep a ſlow pace, then willingly out-go the yong and tender Lambs: O deſpiſe them not here, with
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:117624:128"/> whom we ſhall have eternal company in heaven; it may be they can reach no higher then the very Principles of Religion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they could not be ſafe: yet if they know and can ſay any thing of God in Chriſt Jeſus, or if they would fain hear of him, be not too high for their Society; neglect not the rear of the Chriſtian army, but ſtrive with their infirmity or unfitneſs, whatſoever it be.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In encouraging weak beginners: bid them welcom that ſtand upon the threſhold, that linger in the porch of this Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and would be glad to ſit down among the Diſciples of Chriſt.

                  <p n="6">6. In ſtirring up the Spirits and gifts of one another: <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider one another</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>to provoke unto love and to good works;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 10.24, 25.</note> 
                     <hi>not forſaking the aſſembling of our ſelves together, but exhorting one another.</hi> A mean perſon by asking a queſtion, may lay the firſt ſtone, whereupon a goodly frame of excellent and rich diſcourſe may be reared: Chriſtians muſt quicken one another in the ways of godlineſs; as the iron ſharpeneth iron, as rubbing of the hands makes both warm, and as live coals makes the reſt to burn, ſo let the fruit of Society be mutual, ſharpning, warming and inflaming.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. In raiſing, chearing, comforting the dejected and diſmaid Spirit: How did the Martyrs in their Priſons ſet one another at liberty from the bondage of fears? how did holy <hi>Bradford</hi>'s ſweet and chearful company, make the very dungeons lightſom, and Pallace-like to his fellow-priſoners? An unbelieving heart, oppreſſed many times with fooliſh cares and fears, doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (by a word duly ſpoken, or by a Promiſe applyed in the ſeaſon of it) feel the load quite taken away.</p>

                     <p>IT was anſwered, That this <hi>Caſe</hi> might better be reſolved by experience then Scripture; and accordingly ſome preferred publike Prayer for theſe Reaſons:—</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe in publike they are ſtirred up by others; but in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate or ſecret Prayer, they had none others to joyn with them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe in publike they that exerciſed had more excellent gifts, which exceedingly tend to their edification; but in ſecret they found themſelves weak, and dull, and dead-hearted ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily.</p>
                     <p>Others anſwered otherwiſe, and preferred ſecret Prayer on theſe grounds:—</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe in ſecret they could confeſs more inlargedly and feelingly their own ſins, then others could do it for them in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, to whom they were not particularly known.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe in ſecret they had fewer occaſions of diſtraction, then in publike, and conſequently they kept cloſer to God in the Duty.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Becauſe they found by experience, that in ſecret their hearts were more up; and when they themſelves were to perform in publike, the Society whom they joyned with, did ordinarily more ſtraiten them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Becauſe in ſecret they could take more pains with their heart; as in midſt of Prayer to proſtrate, or by breaking off to meditate, &amp;c. which conveniently they could not do in publike.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. For preparation, it is of ſuch neceſſity, that the want and neglect of it, is the cauſe that the word to many becomes the <hi>ſavor of death unto death;</hi> and to ſome profeſſors, even of good hearts and affections, but a dead letter, without any life or power in it. Is it not a general complaint of the beſt Chriſtians, that they are ordinarily poſſeſſed with much deadneſs of heart, and dulneſs of ſpirit at theſe holy exerciſes? Alas, their zeal and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency which ſhould be quickned and inflamed at every Sermon, is dull and benumb'd with ſenſleſneſs and ſatiety; they do not tremble at divine Comminations, and denouncements of Gods Judgements againſt ſin; they are not ſo refreſhed with the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promiſes of life and ſalvation, as they ought to be; they do not enjoy and reap the thouſandth part of that delight, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and benefit as they well might, by the Miniſtery of the Word; they do not with that chearfulneſs receive, with that ſweetneſs taſte or reliſh, with that life and vigour digeſt the food of life; they do not ſo clearly ſee and diſcern the infinite beauty of the ſacred Majeſty repreſented unto them, or that glorious grace, ſhining unto them in the face of Chriſt Jeſus; their hand of faith doth not with that feeling and faſtneſs lay hold upon,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:117624:146"/> and claſp about the rich treaſures revealed in the Goſpel: and why? becauſe their hearts are not purged and prepared for hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This duty then is of great neceſſity, and ſpecial uſe, for all thoſe which look for benefit or bleſſing by the preaching of the word: <hi>Take heed how ye hear</hi> (ſaith Chriſt;<note place="margin">Luke 8.18.</note>) and <hi>Take heed to thy foot</hi> (ſaith the Preacher) <hi>when thou goeſt to the houſe of God; and be more ready to hear, then to offer the ſacrifice of fools,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But underſtand we aright: God would not have us make an Idol of preparation, as if therefore God draws nigh to us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are prepared; No, no: though preparation in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe is a means to finde God, yet doth God ſometimes hide himſelf when his people are prepared? he would have us know, that if he be found of us at all, it is of meer mercy; he is not bound in Juſtice (ſetting aſide his Promiſe) to reward this preparation: it's but our duty, and he can eſpy in it matter enough of diſpleaſure, but ordinarily the godly finde God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their preparation; and hereto the current of the Scripture bears witneſs, <hi>They that ſeek the Lord, ſhall praiſe him:</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. In <hi>Prayer: If thou cryeſt after knowledge, and liftest up thy voyce for underſtanding;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 2.3, 5.</note>— <hi>then ſhalt thou underſtand the fear of the Lord, and finde out the knowledge of God.</hi> Chriſt bids us pray <hi>for our daily bread,</hi> and a bleſſing upon it; much more ſhould we pray for a bleſſing upon our Spiritual food,<note place="margin">Deut. 8.3.

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:117624:147"/> out of the mouth of the Lord, doth man live.</hi> Now the particulars we are to pray for, are theſe:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the Miniſter, <hi>that God would open unto him a door of utterance,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 4.3, 4.</note> 
                     <hi>to ſpeak the myſteries of Chriſt;</hi> — and <hi>that he may make it manifeſt as he ought to ſpeak. Direct him, Lord</hi> (ſhould every ſoul ſay) <hi>that he may ſpeak fitly to me, ſomewhat for my underſtanding, ſomewhat for my affections, ſomewhat to help me againſt ſuch or ſuch a temptation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the Congregation, that Chriſt may ride with triumph in the midſt of them, that ſome may be converted, others may be confirmed and ſtrengthned in their moſt holy faith.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For our ſelves, that through Gods aſſiſtance we may hear profitably, and be bleſſed in the hearing; that God would help us in our Preparation, Meditation, Examination, in the purging of our hearts, and putting them into a right diſpoſition and frame:<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.18.</note> 
                     <hi>Open thou mine eyes</hi> (ſaid <hi>David) that I may ſee the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful things contained in thy law.</hi>

In <hi>Meditation: I thought on my ways</hi> (ſaid <hi>David) and turned my feet unto thy teſtimonies;</hi> he firſt looked over his own ways, before he would ſet his feet into Gods ways.— Now the matter of our <hi>Meditation</hi> is, 1. Who we are, to hear Gods Word: Alas, poor handfuls of duſt and aſhes, baſe and vile; thus <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> in their converſes with God confeſs: and this conſideration will ſtir-up our humility and repentance in us. 2. Into whoſe preſence we come: Is it not into the preſence of an high, and holy, and powerful God? Is it not the Lord, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon both of greateſt place, and ſupreme authority? This conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration will further our reverence and reſpect of God. When <hi>Iobs eye did ſee God,</hi>

                     <hi>he abhorred himſelf in dust and aſhes.</hi> 3. By whoſe aſſiſtance we come; we have no ſtrength of our own to do any good, nor is there any thing in us, that can procure fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor and acceptance with God, we muſt therefore by faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon Chriſt for aſſiſtance and acceptance: This conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will ſtir up our humility and faith. 4. With what affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we come; if we come to purpoſe, we muſt come with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Spiritual affections, with willingneſs, chearfulneſs, reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, repentance, love, humility and faith. 5. To what end we come; whether it be to Gods glory, and our own ſouls good.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="267" facs="tcp:117624:147"/>3. In Examination, let us ſearch and try our ways:<note place="margin">Lam. 3 40.</note>— <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune with your own hearts;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 4.4, 5.</note> — <hi>and then offer to God the ſacrifice of righteouſneſs.</hi>— Now the matter of Examination is, 1. The general frame and temper of our hearts, whether they be in a better or worſe temper then formerly. 2. The ſpecial occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, for which our ſouls at ſuch or ſuch a time deſire to meet God: It is the complaint of ſome, <hi>I am weak in knowledge;</hi> of others, <hi>I want ſuch and ſuch graces;</hi> of others, <hi>I am like to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter ſuch and ſuch temptations:</hi> of all theſe we are to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our ſelves, that we may accordingly receive ſupply. 3. Our ſins, that we might have them ſlain by the ſword of the Spirit in the Miniſtery of the Word. 4. Our graces, that we may have them ſtrengthned and nouriſhed by the Spiritual food of our ſouls. But the handling of theſe at large, I ſhall leave to the <hi>Receiving of the Lords Supper.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. In <hi>the purging or cleanſing of our hearts,</hi> 1. From ſin; <hi>Lay apart all filthineſs and ſuperfluity of naughtineſs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iames 1.21.</note> 
                     <hi>and receive with meekneſs the ingrafted word, which is able to ſave your ſouls:</hi> with which agrees that parallel place, <hi>Wherefore putting away all malice, as new born babes deſire the ſincere milk of the word;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet 2.1, 2.</note> as it is with the body, when the ſtomack is foul and clogged with bad humors, we ſhould firſt purge it, before we feed it, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe whatſoever we eat, will but nouriſh and increaſe the corrupt humors: ſo when the ſoul is ſtuffed or clogged with ſin, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is heard in the Miniſtery of the word, will but be abuſed by it, and wreſted to the deſtruction of it. 2. From worldly cares and thoughts, which may draw away the heart: <hi>The cares of the world</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>do choak the ſeed of the word.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 13.22.</note> When <hi>Abraham</hi> went up to the Mount to ſacrifice, he left his ſervants in the valley; and when we go up to the Mount where God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, we ſhould leave all our ſervile affections, and worldly thoughts in the valley; or if any enter, we ſhould do by them as <hi>Abraham</hi> did by the birds that would have eaten up his ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, <hi>chaſe them away.</hi> It is ſaid, that in the Temple, though there was much fleſh for ſacrifice, yet there was not one flie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſtirring. O that it might be ſo with us, that not one thought might ariſe upon our hearts, unſuitable to the place or work at hand: But this is the miſery, we have not Spiritual hearts in temporal imployments, and therefore we have carnal
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:117624:148"/> hearts in ſpiritual imployments, the leſs of the Sabbath in the week, the more of the week we finde in the Sabbath.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In <hi>a right diſpoſition in our hearts:</hi> We muſt have hearts ſeaſoned, 1. With <hi>ſoftneſs,</hi> for if the heart be not ſoft and flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the power of the Word will not make any print or deep impreſſion upon it; all holy admonitions, reproofs and inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will be but as arrows ſhot againſt a ſtone wall. 2. With <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 25.9.</note> 
                     <hi>For them that be meek will he guide in judgement, and teach the humble his way:</hi> The proud heart is ſo ſwelled with the wind of vanity and vain-glory, of ſelf-love and over-weening con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that there is left no room in it for the precious treaſures of ſaving Grace to enter. 3. With <hi>honeſty, For honeſt hearts are the profitable and fruitful hearers,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 8.15.</note> reſembled by the good ground; hearts that have no maner of purpoſe to live and continue in any one known ſin; hearts ready and reſolved to ſerve and pleaſe God in all the ways of his Commandments, and that ſincerely and continually. 4. With <hi>faith,</hi> for this makes the Word ſink and ſoak into the ſoul with power and profit. The old Jews <hi>heard the Word,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 4.2.</note> 
                     <hi>but it profited them not, becauſe it was not mixed with faith in them that heard it:</hi> Faith animates and inſpires the promiſes of the Goſpel, with ſuch a ſoveraign ſweetneſs, that they are able to raiſe us from the depth of fears, yea, to put us into a Paradice of ſpiritual pleaſures, and poſſeſſion of Heaven, as it were already. 5. With <hi>teachableneſs: Sacrifice and burnt offerings thou wouldſt not</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) but mine ears haſt thou prepared;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 40.6.</note> 
                     <hi>q.d.</hi> Thou haſt boared new ears in my heart, that I can now reverently attend unto, rightly conceive, and with an holy greedineſs devour (as it were) the myſteries of Grace.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. With <hi>openneſs, or readineſs to receive every truth that God ſhall teach us:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 17.11.</note> It is ſaid of the <hi>Bereans, That they received the Word with all readineſs of minde:</hi> When there is ſuch an holy diſpoſition in us, as to receive both in judgement and practice whatſoever God ſhall reveal to us out of his holy Word, this is a precious diſpoſition.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of preparation, before we hear: what follows, but that we open our hearts and hands? Surely the windows of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will be ſet wide open, that all maner of ſpiritual comforts, all the bleſſings of peace and happineſs, may in abundance be ſhowered down upon us; the rich treaſury of everlaſting glory
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:117624:148"/> and mortality, ſhall be now unlocked to us, and we may row and tumble our ſelves amidſt the mountains of heavenly pearls, and golden pleaſures, joys that no heart can comprehend, but that which is weaned from all worldly pleaſures, and ſet apart, and ſanctified for all holy ſervices and buſineſs of Heaven.</p>

                  <p>OUr <hi>Duties in hearing,</hi> conſiſts in theſe particulars:—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That we ſet our ſelves in Gods preſence whiles we are hearing the Word, and that we conſider it is God we have to deal withal in this buſineſs, and not man, and that it is Gods Word; and not mans: This was the great commendation of the <hi>Theſſalonians, That they received the Word as the Word of God;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Theſſ 2.13. Luke 10.16.</note> and it is the expreſs ſaying of our Savior, <hi>He that heareth you, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me:</hi> The Lord himſelf is preſent in a ſpecial maner, where his Word is preached; <hi>Surely the Lord is in that place,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 28.16.</note> as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid of <hi>Bethel:</hi> Now this apprehenſion of Gods preſence in the aſſemblies of his people, will preſerve our hearts from roving and wandring thoughts: <hi>I hate vain thoughts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.113</note> 
                     <hi>but thy Law do I love;</hi> yea, it will keep us in that awful and reverent diſpoſition that is meet for the majeſty of Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That we diligently attend to that we hear,<note place="margin">Luke 19 48.</note> thus <hi>all the people were very attentive to hear Chriſt;</hi> or (as it is in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal) <hi>They hanged upon him to hear him;</hi> they ſo carried them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as if their ears and mindes had been tyed to his very tongue: Look as a Priſoner will hearken to the ſentence of a Prince, every word he ſpeaks being life or death; or as the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of <hi>Benhadad,</hi> when they were in their enemies power, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved diligently if any word of comfort would come from the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and they did haſtily catch at it; ſo ſhould we with all diligence and attention hearken to the good word of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That we labor to underſtand what we hear; to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>Chriſt called to the multitude and ſaid,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 15 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Hear and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand:</hi> Now the means to underſtand the Word are theſe: 1. Come
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:117624:149"/> to the Word with a willing minde to learn; though the Eunuch <hi>understood not what he read,</hi> yet becauſe he had a minde to learn, the Lord provided for him, and we know what a comfortable ſucceſs <hi>Philips</hi> ſermon had with him: Men love to teach willing Schollars, ſo doth God when we come with willing and ready mindes to be taught of him. 2. Be well acquainted with the Grounds and Principles of Chriſtianity; it is the want of this that makes men dull in underſtanding; they that are not firſt well nouriſhed with milk, will not be fit to receive and digeſt ſtronger meat; if the foundation be not well laid, it is in vain to build. 3. Walk according to the light revealed; <hi>A good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding have all they that do his Commandments:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 111.10.</note> If we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy well the little knowledge we have, there is a promiſe to give us more.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That we hear the Word with all ſpiritual ſubjection, as that Word which hath power to command the ſoul and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: God to this purpoſe looks into a Congregation, to ſee what hearts will yield to his Word; the Spirit of God hovers over the Congregation, and here it waits, and there it expects, to this man it comes, and knocks at the door of his heart, to that man and the other man it goes, ſaying, <hi>Open your hearts, you everlaſting doors, that the King of Glory may come in:</hi> Surely now ſhould we ſay, <hi>Theſe are Gods teſtimonies, this is the Word the Miniſter of God ſpeaks to me in Gods ſtead, I muſt give account of it, and therefore I will ſubmit my ſelf to it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. That we hear the Word, with application of it to our own hearts and lives;<note place="margin">Iob 5.27.</note> 
                     <hi>Hear this, and know it for thy ſelf:</hi> ſo did Chriſts Diſciples when our Savior told them, that one of them ſhould betray him,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.21, 22.</note> 
                     <hi>They were exceeding ſorrowful, and began every one of them to ſay, Lord, is it I?</hi> as no plaiſter can do the Patient any good, unleſs it be applied; and as no meat is able to do us good, unleſs it be eaten and digeſted, no more can the Word preached profit us, unleſs it <hi>be mixed with faith,</hi> one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal work whereof is to apply thoſe things that are delivered in the Word, and this is the meaning of the Prophet, <hi>Hearken di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently unto me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 55.2.</note> 
                     <hi>and eat ye that which is good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. That in hearing, we look to our <hi>affections,</hi> that they be rightly exerciſed: Thus <hi>Joſiah</hi> his heart is ſaid to <hi>melt at the reading of the Law:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Chro. 34.27</note> Thus the Jews at <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon were
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:117624:149"/> 
                     <hi>pricked in their hearts, and ſaid,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 2.37.</note> 
                     <hi>Men and brethren what ſhall we do?</hi> Thus the hearts of the two Diſciples that went to <hi>Emmaus, burned within them, when Christ opened to them the Scriptures:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 24.32.</note> Now the means to ſtir up theſe affections, are, 1. A belief of the Word, as that which is undoubtedly true: <hi>God cannot lye,</hi> Tit. 1.2. <hi>Nor will he change his minde,</hi> Numb. 23.19. 2. A love of the Word, for it is purity, perfection, uſefulneſs, and wonderful benefits to us. 3. An appropriation of the Word unto our ſelves, for that which affects us, is that which moſt nearly concerns us; without this means of quickning our hearts, they remain dead and ſenſleſs, and the Word becomes utterly unprofitable. 4. A conſideration of the nature of the Word, which ever requires and calls for ſuitable hearts and affections; it is <hi>a pure Word,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.140</note> and therefore we muſt cleanſe and purifie our hearts for the receiving of it; it is <hi>ſpiritual and heavenly,</hi>

                  <p>THe Duties required after hearing the word, are theſe:—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That we carefully remember, and keep that which we have heard:<note place="margin">Prov. 4.4, 21.</note> 
                     <hi>My ſon, let thine heart retain my words,—keep them in the midst of thine heart.</hi> As a man that hath a Jewel will be careful to lock it up in his ſafeſt Cheſt, ſo ſhould we keep the word in our hearts, in the midſt of our hearts. Many hear the word deſirouſly, but (as we ſay) it goes in at one ear, and out at the other, it ſtays not for any after-uſe, but a little preſent admiration: others hear, and the word ſmites them a little on their Conſciences, and wounds them, and one would think ſome good thing would be wrought on them, but they go away, and the motion dyes; like unto mettals which are ſoft and plyable, whileſt they are in the fire, but ſhortly after they become harder then before.<note place="margin">Heb. 2.1.</note> 
                     <hi>Take earneſt heed to the things which we have heard, leſt at any time we ſhould let them ſlip;</hi> or <hi>let them run out as a leaking veſſel,</hi> for ſo the Original bears it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That we meditate, and ſeriouſly think of that we have heard:<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.15.</note> 
                     <hi>Meditate upon theſe things</hi> (ſaid <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy) give thy ſelf wholly to them, that thy profiting may appear to all:</hi> Thus <hi>Mary pondred the words of the Angel in her heart,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 2.19. Pſal. 119.97.</note> and <hi>David meditated all the day on Gods law:</hi> Meditation is as the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of the ſoul, that doth kindle and inflame holy affections: Meditation is of a ſeperating and ſetling nature, it ſeperates hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly thoughts from earthly, for it often goes over with thoughts, and at laſt ſettles the heart on ſuch thoughts as theſe, <hi>O this is the word of God, this is the law, the proclamation of the great King, whereby I muſt be judged: This may be the laſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon that ever I ſhall hear whiles I live, ſuch a gale of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit may never be offered to me again: I will be wiſe therefore, and give way to the Spirit of God, I will not beat it back again, but

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. That we repeat what we have heard, and confer of it, and examine the Scriptures about the truth of it:<note place="margin">Pſa. 119.172.</note> 
                     <hi>My tongue</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) ſhall ſpeak of thy word, for all thy Commandments are righteouſneſs:</hi> and,<note place="margin">Deut. 11.18, 19.</note>

                     <hi>They ſearched the Scriptures daily, concerning the things that were delivered by Paul:</hi> A man that comes into a pleaſant garden, will not content himſelf with the preſent ſcent onely, but will carry ſome of the flowers away with him: So after we have been in the <hi>Garden of ſpices,</hi> and have felt <hi>the ſavor of Chriſts oyntments</hi> in Church-Aſſemblies, let us take ſome of the flowers away with us, and ſmell of them again and again. <hi>Repeating, conferring, examining the word,</hi> is as the pounding of ſpices, that will make them ſmell more.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That we put in practice whatſoever we hear:<note place="margin">Iames 1.22.</note> 
                     <hi>Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers onely, deceiving your own ſouls;</hi> we muſt <hi>do it,</hi> we muſt bring it nearer to us, that it may be an ingrafted word in our underſtanding and affections, that it may be written in our ſouls, and in the tables of our hearts; that it may be incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated and naturalized into our inward man, that ſo we may ſpeak and think, and do nothing but that which is divine: and in doing, obſerve we this frame of Spirit, to be quick and ſpeedy about it: <hi>I made haſte,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.60.</note> 
                     <hi>and prolonged not the time to keep thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments;</hi> This ſpeedy, this immediate putting of the word into practice, is much advantage to the hearer; the affections of the heart are then lively and quick, which with delays dye and decay ſuddenly.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That (when the word is heard, and we are returned home) that we pray again for a bleſſing on that we have heard, and as our memories will bear, let us turn the word into prayer, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the heads or principal parts of it: Prayer muſt be the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the <hi>beginning</hi> and <hi>ending</hi> of this Spiritual duty; we muſt pray in preparation, and pray in concluſion, and <hi>pray always.</hi> And thus much concerning our <hi>Duties</hi> before, in,<note place="margin">Luke 21.36.</note> and after the <hi>Hearing the Word.</hi>

                     <pb n="298" facs="tcp:117624:162"/> ſo that Chriſt is full, and ever ſhall be full to the brim; there is in him a fulneſs of merit, for our juſtification, and a fulneſs of ſpirit, and habitual Graces for our ſanctification: <hi>In him are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge (i.)</hi> vaſt heaps,<note place="margin">Col. 2.3.</note> for ſome pieces of ſilver and gold, are not <hi>treaſures; all the treaſures,</hi> all the heaps of <hi>Knowledge and wiſdom</hi> that are in the world, all are in him; he <hi>is all in all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Faith caſts its eye on the promiſe, for the conveyance of Chriſt, and of Grace from Chriſt: Faith works by vertue of the promiſe; where there is no promiſe, there can be no faith, and therefore faith diſcovers the promiſe, <hi>That of his fulneſs we ſhall receive grace for grace;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iohn 1.16.</note> 
                     <hi>That his body is given for us; That his blood is ſhed for us, and for many, for the remiſsion of ſins:</hi> Hence the ſchools admit of a double fulneſs <hi>(i.) Of abundance and redundance:</hi> The promiſe ſpeaks not onely of the fulneſs <hi>of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance</hi> in Chriſt, whereby he is ſufficiently full in himſelf, but alſo of a fulneſs of <hi>redundance,</hi> by which he overflows and fills all his Saints: He is the well-head or fountain, which is not onely full it ſelf, but ſprings and flows over to the filling of the ſtreams below it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Faith looks upon this Ordinance, as an inſtrument, a means which God hath ſet up for the conveying of Chriſt, and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Chriſt: in <hi>Zachary</hi> we finde mention of two <hi>olive branches,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zech. 4.12.</note> 
                     <hi>which through two golden pipes, emptied the golden oyl out of themſelves:</hi> We may thus interpret, Chriſt is the olive branch, and the olive tree, and from whom comes all the golden oyl of Grace and ſpiritual comfort, and he it is that empties it out of himſelf, into our hearts; but how? it is by his Ordinances, they be the golden pipes, by which this golden oyl is conveyed unto us: Chriſt doth not immediately empty the oyl into our hearts, but firſt into the golden pipes of his Ordinances, and ſo through them into us.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Faith being ſteeled by ſuch conſiderations as theſe, it goes over to Chriſt, and by vertue of the promiſe, draws down his <hi>body and blood</hi> into the ſoul; this therefore is the main work, to awaken, and to actuate our faith, to ſet it on work upon Chriſt, and ſo to draw forth the efficacy of Chriſt in the Sacrament: <hi>Lord, I believe that thy body was given for me, thy blood ſhed for me, and for the remiſſion of many ſins: Lord, I chearfully and gladly
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:117624:162"/> believe that I am now partaker of thy body and blood, and that my ſins are pardoned in thy blood: I believe that Chriſt is mine, his death is mine, his reſurrection is mine, remiſſion of ſins is mine, pardon and heaven are mine: Lord, I accept, I believe this ſealed pardon of my ſin: Lord, I believe that all Chriſt, whole Chriſt is mine, from top to toe: Lord, I believe his perſon is mine, his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head is mine, his Manhood is mine: Lord, I believe his merit is mine, his vertue is mine, his benefits both of Grace and Glory are mine: Lord, I believe that in Chriſt all fulneſs dwells, and that of his fulneſs I ſhall receive grace for grace: Lord, I believe that through this golden pipe of the Lords Supper, I ſhall receive the golden oyl of Grace from Chriſt, now be it to me according to my faith: Lord, I believe, help thou my unbelief: O come down into my ſoul, and fill it full of the Lord Chriſt, of the body and blood of Chriſt.</hi> In this maner, as one ſaid of the tree of Chriſts aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though the fruit were high, and above our reach, yet if we touch him by the hand of faith, and tongue of prayer, all will fall down upon us: So here, if we can but touch him with the hand of faith, though a palſie hand, though a weak and trembling hand, if we can but go to him with a praying heart, Chriſt can withhold nothing from us.</p>
                  <p>By the way, this may diſcover to us where the fault is; when we return home, our faith never the more ſtretched, our hearts never the more warmed, our Graces never the more nouriſhed, our corruptions never the more weakned, our aſſurance never the more heightned, it is a ſhrewd ſign faith did not play its part in the Mount: <hi>Faith</hi> was intruſted in this imployment, to go over to Chriſt for theſe and the like benefits, but thy <hi>faith</hi> did fail in the undertaking; therefore God, ſuſpends the beſtowing of theſe benefits, becauſe thou ſuſpendeſt thy <hi>faith:</hi>—Well then, if thou ſee not the fruit and benefit thou expectedſt, to come into thy ſoul in the uſe of this Ordinance, charge thy <hi>faith</hi> with it, and bewail the weakneſs of it; and for the future, put it to its bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, let it have its full and perfect work, and thou wilt then finde the comfort and fruit of it: Never did <hi>faith</hi> touch Chriſt in any Ordinance, but vertue came from him.</p>

Let ſuch a one ſuſpect himſelf, that ſome miſcarriage hath been in him, either in his preparation to, or in his performance of the Duty; and let him labor. to finde out where the fail was; what it was that hindred the efficacy of that <hi>Bleſſed</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: and having found out what hindred, let him judge himſelf for it, and be ſeriouſly humbled therefore: If he can but do thus, he needs not be overmuch diſmaid, becauſe this is one fruit of the life of Chriſt, which was undoubtedly received in the Sacrament; if he have not that which he would have, yet he hath that which was worth the going for: Let him conſtrue this <hi>Humiliation</hi> as a fruit of going to the Sacrament, and be thankful for that.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let him endeavor by after-pains in prayer and humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to quicken and awaken the efficacy of the Sacrament: <hi>Sacraments do not always work for the preſent, but the efficacy may come afterwards;</hi> the actions of God are of eternal effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, though he put forth that efficacy in ſuch times and ſeaſons as he ſees good. Phyſick doth not always work when it is taken, but ſometimes afterward: Thus alſo it may be with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, when a Communicant humbled for his unprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the <hi>Duty,</hi> endeavors by after-diligence and humiliation, to quicken and put life into it, it may work then. What hinders but it may be in the caſe of the Lords Supper, as in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptiſm? the efficacy and force of Baptiſm doth not preſently appear, no not preſently upon the years of diſcretion: many a one lives viciouſly in a ſinful courſe, a Swearer, Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, &amp;c. yet afterwards when God gives a man the heart to be touched with the ſenſe of ſin, and he begins to beſtir himſelf, to ſeek God by faith and repentance, the Lord then quickens his Baptiſm, and makes it as powerful and efficacious, as if it had been adminiſtred that very day: So in this caſe poſſibly a man hath been at the Lords Table, and hath more then once been
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:117624:164"/> an unworrhy receiver, yet if he ſhall once come to be humbled for that unworthineſs, God will make Sacraments ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived unprofitably, to become efficacious unto him: If then we have miſcarried in our preparations and diſpoſitions, ſo as we have found no benefit, no comfort, yet here is a remedy and help. Take this courſe by after-diligence, and after-humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to fetch life into the Ordinance in which we were dead, and which was dead unto us.</p>

This is a mercy, in which all other mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are folded up: Chriſt doth eminently contain all other mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and in the want of all, Chriſt enjoyed is <hi>exceeding great reward;</hi> nay, all mercies are not onely folded up in him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed to him, but he ſweetens and ſanctifies every mercy: let us then return home, as full of the bleſſing from on high, ſo full of <hi>praiſes</hi> to the moſt high: <hi>Thankfulneſs</hi> is the great grace to be excerciſed in, and <hi>Thankfulneſs</hi> is the great grace to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed after; and therefore while the preſent ſenſe of this mercy warms our hearts, let the heat of it burſt forth into <hi>Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> toward God; it is the moſt ſuitable ſervice, and the moſt ſuitable time to return it.</p>

Hath he taken off my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer burthen, and caſt it on the back of his dear Son, and ſhall I again lay more load on him? Hath he ſpoken peace to me in his Ordinance, and ſhall I again return to folly? No, far be it from me: I have waſhed my feet, how ſhall I again defile them? I have put off my coat, how ſhall I again put it on?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Get we our hearts further ſtrengthned to ſervice: In this Ordinance is a mutual ſealing of Covenants between God and us; he ſeals to the firſt part of the Covenant, Pardon, Mercy, Grace, and we muſt ſeal to the ſecond part of it, Service, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, Obedience. God gives Chriſt to us, and we are to give our ſelves back again to Chriſt. As there is matter of <hi>Bounty</hi> from God to us, ſo there is matter of <hi>Duty</hi> from us to God: There was never any ſoul, to whom God ſaid in this Ordinance, <hi>I am thine,</hi> whoſe heart did not eccho again to the ſame God, <hi>Lord, I am thine.</hi> Let us then labor to get our hearts further ſtrengthned to ſervice. And thus much concerning our duties before, in, and after the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. The Impediments to be removed are theſe:—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We muſt lay aſide all carnal thoughts, and worldly cares, which might diſtract our mindes:<note place="margin">Eccles 5.1.</note> 
                     <hi>Keep thy foot when thou goeſt to Gods houſe,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon; q.d.</hi> look with what affection and diſpoſition thou comeſt to God in prayer.</p>

                     <hi>I will that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. We muſt avoid ſurfeting and drunkenneſs, which makes the heart dull and heavy: <hi>Take heed to your ſelves,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 21 34, 53.</note> 
                     <hi>leſt at any time your hearts be overcharged with ſurfeting and drunkenneſs, and the cares of this world;</hi> with ordinary prayer we muſt joyn a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate diet, and with extraordinary, faſting.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. We muſt draw off from prayer, from reſting in it, or truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it; a man may pray much, and in ſtead of drawing nigh to God, or injoying ſweet communion with Chriſt, he may draw nigh to prayer, his thoughts may be more upon his prayer, then upon God to whom he prays; and he may live more upon his cuſhion, then upon Chriſt: but when a man indeed draws nigh to God in prayer, he forgets prayer, and remembers God, and prayer goes for nothing, but Chriſt is all.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Praying with feigned lips, this is to pray with an heart and an heart, as all hypocrites do: but 'tis otherwiſe with the Saints: <hi>Hear the right, O Lord, attend unto my cry,</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. Praying with wandring thoughts, ariſing partly from the fleſh, and partly from the ſuggeſtions of Satan: The ſpeech of the mouth muſt not go before, but always follow after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the minde: Many times as a Muſicians fingers will run over a ſong which he hath been uſed to play, although his minde be otherwiſe occupied; ſo many in prayer will run over that form of words they have been uſed to utter, though their mindes be roving about other matters: Such a prayer is called, Lip-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor: O let the abſurdity of the fault, breed in us a loathing of it; Do our mindes wander in prayer? endeavor we to joyn into one ſpeech, the prayer of the mouth, and the ſpeech of the heart, both which ſound in Gods ears, and then conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we would make ſuch a ſpeech (I ſay not with <hi>Malachi,</hi>

It is good to diſtinguiſh of the cauſe whence theſe wandring thoughts may ariſe; if they come from weakneſs in our ſelves, or from the temptations of
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:117624:167"/> Satan, the Lord will conſider this, and deal mercifully with us; but if they ariſe from meer negligence, or voluntary admitting of looſe thoughts, that is our ſin, and we had need to repent and mourn for it.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.26.</note>2. By the help of the Spirit: <hi>It is the Spirit that helps our infirmities</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it ſelf maketh interceſſion for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered; q.d.</hi> when we put forth the graces of the Spirit in us, then the Spirit comes and helps, and what comes from us now, it comes from the breathings of the Spirit. This <hi>helping of the Spirit</hi>] is very Emphatical in the Original; as a man taking up an heavy piece of timber by the one end, cannot alone get it up, till ſome other man takes it up at the other end, and ſo <hi>helps</hi> him: So the poor ſoul that is a pulling and tugging with his own heart, he findes it heavy and dull, like a log in a ditch, and he can do no good with it, till at laſt the Spirit of God comes at the other end, and takes the heavieſt end of the burthen, and ſo helps the ſoul to lift it up.

In regard of Aſſiſtance: We pray, but we have no ſtrength to do it without Chriſt; we might as well be ſet to move Mountains, as to pray without the ſtrength of Chriſt: <hi>Without me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>you can do nothing;</hi> without union with Chriſt, without communion with Chriſt,<note place="margin">Iohn 15.5.</note> we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: from Chriſt we muſt have both operating and co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating ſtrength, both inherent and aſſiſtant ſtrength; otherwiſe though we have grace, we ſhall not be able to perform any work, nor exerciſe our own graces: it is he that muſt work all our works in us and for us, the inherent work of grace within us, and the required works of duty for us: And bleſſed be that God, who hath given to us what he requireth of us, and hath not onely made Precepts Promiſes, but Promiſes Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In regard of Acceptance: Our works, they are not onely impotent, but impure too, as they come from us: It is <hi>Chriſt</hi> that muſt put validity to them, it is <hi>Chriſt</hi> that muſt put his own odours to them, it is Chriſt that muſt put both Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Merit to them, his grace to work, and his blood to own them, for whatever comes from his Spirit, it is preſented through his Merit: Here is great comfort: Do we look over
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:117624:168"/> our performances, &amp; wonder that ever God ſhould accept them? ſo much deadneſs, ſo little life, ſo much coldneſs? conſider then, that God looks upon them, not as ours, but as Chriſts, in whom not onely our perſons, but our performances are accepted: Chriſt gives us his ſpirit, and Chriſt is willing to own what we preſent by his Spirit, and God is willing to own whatever is preſented to him by Chriſt his Son. This rightly conſidered, it will cauſe us in every petition put up, to think our ſelves ſo much beholding to Chriſt, that we ſhall be ready to ſay in our hearts, when any petition is granted, <hi>I may thank Jeſus Chriſt for this.</hi>

                     <hi>But what is it to pray in Chriſts name?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, 1. To pray <hi>in Chriſts name,</hi> is to pray with reliance upon the grace, favor and worthineſs of the merits of Chriſt, <hi>in whom we have believed,</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. To pray <hi>in Chriſts name,</hi> is to pray from his command, and according to his will; as when we ſend another in our name, we wiſh him to ſay thus,<note place="margin">Hoſea 14.3.</note>

For <hi>Quality,</hi> we need not be curious in reſpect of the ſtile, God looking to the heart, rather then the ſpeech: As it is not the lowdneſs of a Preachers voice, but the weight and holineſs of the matter, and ſpirit of the Preacher, that moves a wiſe and intelligent hearer; ſo not gifts, but graces in prayers, are they that move the Lord: The reaſon, prayer moves not God as an Orator, but as a childe moves his Father: two words of a childe humbled, and crying at his fathers feet, will prevail more then penn'd orations: it is the meaning of the ſpirit that God looks unto, more then the expreſſions, for the

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. For the <hi>Form:</hi> We are not tyed to any ſet form, nor are we ſo tyed to conceived prayer, as that it muſt be without all ſtudy or meditation, either againſt the inſtant, or in former times: A man may conceive a prayer <hi>ex tempore,</hi> and yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Euthuſiaſms, or extraordinary revelations; <hi>viz.</hi> by the help of his former ſtudies and Meditations: and that I may afford ſome help that way, I ſhall in concluſion of this Chapter, lay down a directory for prayer, together with a form of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er (though broken) in Scripture phraſes.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. THe <hi>Duties</hi> ſubſequent, which follow after prayer, are theſe:—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Quietly to reſt in the good will and pleaſure of God, not doubting but the Lord hath heard our Prayers, and in good time ſhall grant that which ſhall be moſt for his glory and our good; and this is the meaning of the word <hi>Amen,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we ſeal up our prayers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Diligently to uſe all good means for the obtaining of our ſuits; as if I pray for <hi>faith,</hi> or any other ſpiritual Grace, I muſt beſides prayer, uſe all good means carefully, which the Lord hath ordained for the begetting and increaſing of thoſe graces in us, as hearing the Word preached, receiving the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, reading the Word, and meditating on it, otherwiſe our prayers are a tempting of God, as if he muſt grant, not by means, but by miracles.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Carefully to look after our prayers, and to caſt up our comings in, and gainings by prayers, otherwiſe we are like fooliſh

                  <p>VVE may reſolve this <hi>caſe,</hi> by ſome obſervations before prayer, in prayer, and after prayer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Before prayer: When God prepares the heart to pray, when he pours upon a man <hi>a Spirit of Grace and Supplication,</hi> a praying diſpoſition; when he puts in motives, ſuggeſts argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and pleas unto God, as materials for prayer; all which
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:117624:172"/> you ſhall finde to come in readily, and of themſelves; and that likewiſe with a quickning heat, and inlargement of affections, with a lingring, and longing, and reſtleſneſs of ſpirit, to pour out the ſoul unto God: This is a ſign that God lends his ear, and will return anſwers: <hi>Thou wilt prepare their heart; thou wilt cauſe thine ear to hear;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 10.17.</note> 
                     <hi>q. d.</hi> Thou faſhioneſt the heart, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeſt it into a praying frame, and that is a ſign, Lord, that thou meaneſt to hear.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>In prayer:</hi> As 1. when God <hi>draws nigh,</hi> and reveals him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to thy ſoul, in and upon ſuch or ſuch a particular petition, when God ſmiles upon thee, welcoms thee, falls about thy neck and kiſſeth thee; when no ſooner thou comes into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to inquire of him, but he ſays, <hi>Here I am,</hi> as the promiſe is, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.9.<note place="margin">Iſa. 58.9.</note> this thou art to obſerve as a ſign that he hears thy prayer,<note place="margin">Pſa. 69.17, 18.</note> and accepts both thee and it: <hi>Hear me ſpeedily</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) and that I may know thou hearest me, draw nigh unto my ſoul,</hi> Pſal. 69.17. 2. When God doth put a reſtleſs importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty into the heart, maugre all diſcouragements, for this or that mercy; and when this importunity is joyned with a ſubjection to Gods will, and runs along with it, then hath God ſtirred it up, and then look for ſomething to come: You know the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,<note place="margin">Luke 18.5.</note> how the unjuſt Judge heard the widow, <hi>for her impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities ſake:</hi> So when God puts this <hi>importunity</hi> into the heart, it is a ſign God means then to hear and anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>After prayer:</hi> This will appear in ſeveral particulars; as—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When God quiets and calms the heart after prayer, by ſpeaking ſomething to the heart, though what is ſpoken be not always diſcerned; as when you ſee an earneſt or importunate ſuitor going in to a great man, exceeding anxious, but coming out very chearful, contented, and quiet in ſpirit, you would conceive that certainly ſomething hath been ſaid to him, which gave him incouragement: So when thou goeſt to God, and haſt been importunate in a buſineſs, and thy deſires were exceedingly up for it, and then thou riſeſt up with thy minde, calmed and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and thou feelſt the anxiouſneſs, the ſolicitude of thy heart, about the thing taken off and diſpelled; this is a good ſign that God hath heard, and will return anſwer to the full: When <hi>Hanna</hi> out of much bitterneſs, and with ſtrong deſires,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:117624:172"/> 
                     <hi>had poured her ſoul out unto the Lord,</hi> it is ſaid,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 1.18.</note> 
                     <hi>That ſhe looked no more ſad;</hi> And then God gave her a ſon, a ſon of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When God gives an obedient, dependent heart, in walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before him, when that conſideration ſtill comes in as a curb unto ſin: If <hi>I regard iniquity in my heart, God will not hear me:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 66.18.</note> When God doth ſtill after praying, keep the ſoul in a more obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient frame of ſpirit; when he keeps thee from uſing ill means, &amp;c. it is a ſign that God hath heard thy prayers, and thou ſhalt have returns: <hi>David</hi> praying for his life, <hi>Hear my prayer,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 143.1.</note> 
                     <hi>O Lord, give ear to my ſupplications; in thy faithfulneſs anſwer me, and in thy righteouſneſs:</hi>—Preſently after he prays for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, knowing that ſin would enervate and ſpoil all his prayers; <hi>Cauſe me to know thy way, wherein I ſhould walk:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">8.</note>—<hi>Teach me to do thy will.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">10.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. When God after prayer, ſtrengtheneth the heart to wait and expect for the mercy deſired; when a man after prayer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to wait rather then pray (though he prays ſtill) becauſe he looks now God ſhould perform; in this caſe, and at this time he may look for ſome good anſwer from God: <hi>David</hi> having prayed, ſays to his ſoul, <hi>Wait on the Lord, be of good courage,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 27.14.</note> 
                     <hi>and he will ſtrengthen the heart: wait, I ſay, on the Lord.</hi>

                  <head>
                     <hi>SECT. 7.</hi> The ſecond Caſe: Suppoſe the thing I deſire ſhall not be anſwered, how may I aſſuredly know that God notwithſtanding doth hear my prayers?</head>
                  <p>VVE may reſolve this caſe, if 1. we obſerve theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whether thy prayer was framed in a right maner? didſt thou not pray abſolutely for ſuch bleſſings, as were never abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely promiſed? if ſo, no wonder thy prayer is denied; or didſt thou pray conditionally (as Chriſt prayed, <hi>If it be poſſible, &amp;c.</hi>) then thy prayer may be heard, and yet the things denyed;
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:117624:173"/> for otherwiſe Chriſt had not been heard, when yet the text ſays, <hi>He was heard in that he feared.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb 5.7.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whether there be not a reſervation in that denial, for ſome greater mercy, whereof that denial was the foundation? if we had many of our deſires, we ſhould be undone: If the childe had lived for which <hi>David</hi> ſo earneſtly prayed, he would but have been a living monument of his own ſhame; God therefore denyed his prayer, but after he gave him a <hi>Solomon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whether God doth not anſwer thee ſtill according to the ground of thy prayer? Now the ground and intent of thy prayer, is after Gods glory, the Churches good, thy own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular comfort; it may be God denies the particular mercy thou deſireſt, and yet he anſwers the ground of thy prayer, his glory ſhall be advanced, his Church preſerved, thy comfort made up (even for that prayer of thine) ſome other way.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Whether God yields not far to give thee ſatisfaction, as if he were tender of denying thee? So the Lord anſwered <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 17.18, 20.</note> when praying for <hi>Iſhmael, O let Iſhmael live in thy ſight!</hi> God went as far in anſwering his requeſt as might be, <hi>I have heard thee</hi> (ſaid God) <hi>and I have bleſſed him, and I will make him fruitful, and multiply him exceedingly, and he ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get twelve Princes; but my covenant I will eſtabliſh with Iſaac.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. What effects that denial hath upon thy heart? as—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whether thy heart be inlarged to acknowledge God to be holy and righteous in his dealings with thee, and thine own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs the cauſe of his denying thee? <hi>I cry in the day time</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) but thou heareſt not:—Yet thou art holy, O thou that inhabiteſt the praiſes of Iſrael.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 22.2, 3.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whether God fills thy heart with holy contentment in the denial?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whether thou canſt be thankful to God out of faith, that God hath ordered all for the beſt, though he hath denyed thee?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Whether thy heart be not diſcouraged, but thou canſt pray ſtill, at leaſt for other things? it moves ingenuous natures to ſee men take repulſes and denials well, and ſo it moves God: Now if the caſe be thus, if upon obſervation thou canſt ſay, that thy prayers, though denyed, were conditional <hi>[if God will]</hi> that thou perceiveſt a reſervation in Gods denial, for ſome greater mercy; that God anſwered thee, at leaſt, according to the
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:117624:173"/> ground of thy prayers, that God yielded far to thee; as if he were loath to deny thy prayers; that thou feeleſt ſuch effects of denial upon thy heart, as theſe:—1. An inlargement, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge God holy and righteous. 2. An holy contentment in the denial. 3. A thankful heart. 4. An heart not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged howſoever. Surely then God hears, or God hath heard thy prayers, although the particular ſuits are not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed.</p>

                  <p>VVE may reſolve this <hi>caſe</hi> by laying open the <hi>duties</hi> apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to ſuch a ſoul: Canſt thou not diſcern Gods deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? ſpy no returns of thy prayers? it is then thy duty—</p>

                  <p n="2">2. To <hi>perſist</hi> and perſevere <hi>in our prayers,</hi> without <hi>fainting,</hi>

                  <p>VVE may reſolve this caſe by giving theſe directions to the ſoul, whereby it may be inabled to diſcern when and how things prayed for, come in by prayer; As</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the maner of Gods performance: When God gives any thing in anſwer to prayers, he often diſcovers a more then ordinary hand of providence i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> it: As</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By bringing it to paſs through many difficulties: Thus <hi>Peter</hi> was delivered out of priſon at the prayers of the Church;<note place="margin">Acts 12.6, 10.</note> and we finde 1. He was ſleeping between two Soldiers, if they had wakened, he had been diſcovered. 2. He was in chains, but they fell off. 3. The Keepers ſtood before the door, but they minded him not. 4. When one watch is paſt, he paſſeth quietly through another. 5. When both thoſe were paſt, an iron gate flies open of its own accord: Now ſuch difficulties are there in many buſineſſes, which yet in the end are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed by prayer; iron chains fall off, iron gates, enemies hearts fly open of their own accord, and though not in that miraculous maner, by the means of an Angel, yet no leſs won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By facilitating all means, and cauſing them to conſpire to accompliſh the thing prayed for; thou haſt wind and tide, and a fair day, and all the way paved and plain before thee; there falls out a great conjunction and meeting of many circumſtances together to effect it, which had influence into it, wherefore if any one had been wanting, haply the thing had not been done: Thus when <hi>Iſrael</hi> went out of <hi>Egypt</hi> (which was the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of their prayers,<note place="margin">Exod. 2.23.</note> 
                     <hi>their cry came up unto God</hi> (ſaith the Text) how were all things facilitated? the Egyptians that detained them, then came and intreated them to go out, <hi>Riſe up,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 12.13.</note> 
                     <hi>and get you forth amongſt my people,</hi> ſaid <hi>Pharaoh; Yea, they were urgent upon the people, that they might ſend them out of the
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:117624:174"/> Land;</hi> yea, <hi>They hired them to go out with their jewels of ſilver,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">33.</note> 
                     <hi>and jewels of gold, and raiment,</hi>

                     <hi>A dog did not move his tongue;</hi> the bruit creatures did not diſturb them, though at midnight, when theſe creatures uſe to be moſt obſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous through noiſes, eſpecially at Travellers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By bringing it to paſs ſuddenly and unexpectedly; as the return of the captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which was the concluſion of many prayers, was done in a trice; <hi>they were as men in a dream,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 126.1.</note> they could ſcarce believe it was ſo, when it was done.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By doing above what was deſired, with addition of other mercies; ſo <hi>Solomon</hi> asked <hi>wiſdom,</hi>

                     <hi>SECT. 10.</hi> The fifth Caſe: Suppoſe that others joyn with me in thoſe prayers now anſwered, how ſhould I know that my prayers had an hand in obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe anſwers, as well as any others?</head>
                  <p>VVE may reſolve this <hi>caſe</hi> by theſe obſervations: As—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If thy heart did ſympathize and accord in the ſame holy affection with thoſe others in praying, then it is certain thy
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:117624:176"/> voyce hath helped to carry it:<note place="margin">Mat. 18.19.</note> 
                     <hi>If two of you ſhall agree on earth,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>as touching any thing that they ſhall ask, it ſhall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven: If two of you ſhall agree</hi> (the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) <hi>q.d.</hi> if you harmonially agree to play the ſame tune (for prayers are <hi>muſick</hi> in Gods ears,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.19.</note> and ſo called <hi>melody to God</hi>) if you agree not onely in the thing prayed for, but in your <hi>affections,</hi> for it is the <hi>affections</hi> that makes the conſort and melody: If the ſame holy <hi>affections</hi> were touch'd and ſtruck by Gods Spirit in thy heart, that was in others, then didſt thou help to make up the conſort, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thee it had been imperfect; yea, without thee the thing might not have been done, for God ſometimes ſtands upon ſuch a number of voyces (as when he named ten perſons in <hi>Sodom</hi>) and ſo one voyce may caſt it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If thy heart be filled with joy in the accompliſhment of what was prayed for, it is an evident argument that thy prayers did move the Lord to effect it, as well as the prayers of others. When good old <hi>Simeon</hi> ſaw his prayers anſwered in ſending the Meſſiah into the world, he was even willing to dye <hi>through joy,</hi> and thought he could never dye in a better time: <hi>Lord, now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 2.29.</note> 
                     <hi>according to thy word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. If the thing concern others, and thy heart be thankful for a bleſſing on others, prayed for by thee with others, it is a ſign thy prayers had ſome hand in it: Thus <hi>Paul</hi> prayed for the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 3.6, 7, 9.</note> and when <hi>Timothy</hi> came, and brought him good tidings of <hi>their faith and charity,</hi> he was not onely <hi>comforted,</hi> but in his raviſhment he cryes, <hi>What thanks can we render again to God for you?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. If the thing concern thy ſelf which was prayed for by others, helping thee in their prayers, what cauſe haſt thou but to think it was granted for thy own prayers, and not for theirs onely? It may be indeed that God heard thee the ſooner through the help of their prayers:<note place="margin">Phil. 1.19.</note> 
                     <hi>I know this ſhall turn to my ſalvation, through your prayers,</hi> ſaid <hi>Paul:</hi> but if God ſtirs up thy heart to pray for thy ſelf, as well as others pray for thee, then God that gave thee an heart to pray, hath heard thy prayers alſo, and hath had a reſpect to thee as well (if not more then) to others, becauſe it concerneth thy ſelf eſpecially, as being a more ſpecial mercy to thee then to others.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. From the ſenſe of our own blindeneſs and ignorance, who of our ſelves <hi>have not the knowledge nor underſtanding of a man,</hi>

                     <hi>SECT. 4.</hi> Of the neceſſary Duties in Reading of the Scriptures.</head>
                  <p>THe duty now fallen upon, it is good for our profiting to obſerve theſe particulars:—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That (in the beginning of our reading the Bible, or of each book in the Bible) we view and read over ſome Analytical Table, that ſo we better mark the drift and ſcope of the holy Ghoſt, and that we may with ſingular eaſe and delight remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the ſame: To that purpoſe I have added ſuch a Table to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of this Chapter, which may well ſerve for the propoſed ends.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That we attend diligently to what we read: Now there is good reaſon for this attention, 1. Becauſe of the authority and wiſdom of him that ſpeaks; <hi>A childe muſt hear his father, Prov.</hi> 4.1.<note place="margin">Prov. 4.1.</note> and a Subject muſt attend reverently to the words of a Ruler, <hi>Job</hi> 29.21.<note place="margin">Iob 29.21.</note> yet none of them is our <hi>Potter</hi> as God is, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.4.<note place="margin">Iſa 63.4.</note> nor <hi>made us as he did, Pſal.</hi> 100.3.<note place="margin">Pſal. 100.3.</note> nor conſequently can chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge ſuch reſpect from us as he may. 2. Becauſe of the matter
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:117624:185"/> or ſubject which the Scriptures handle, not onely for the weight and importance of thoſe high myſteries which are therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,<note place="margin">Iohn 5.39.</note> but for the great intereſt which we our ſelves have in thoſe things,<note place="margin">Deut. 29.29.</note> as containing our <hi>evidences</hi> and directions, which <hi>we and our children muſt obſerve, that we may do them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. That we keep ſtill Jeſus Chriſt in our eye, in the peruſal of the Scripture, as the end, ſcope and ſubſtance thereof: What are the whole Scriptures, but as it were the ſpiritual ſwadling clothes of the holy childe Jeſus? 1. Chriſt is the Truth and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of all the Types and Shadows. 2. Chriſt is the ſubſtance and matter of the Covenant of Grace, under all adminiſtrations thereof; under the Old Teſtament, Chriſt is vailed, under the New Covenant, revealed. 3. Chriſt is the centre and meeting place of all the promiſes,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.20.</note> for in him all the promiſes of God are Yea and Amen. 4. Chriſt is the thing ſignified, ſealed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in the Sacraments of the Old and New Teſtament. 5. Scripture-Genealogies are to lead us on to the true line of Chriſt. 6. Scripture-Chronologies are to diſcover to us the times and ſeaſons of Chriſt. 7. Scripture-Laws are our ſchool-maſter to bring us unto Chriſt,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.20.</note> the Moral by correcting, the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial by directing. 8. Scripture-Goſpel is Chriſts light, whereby we know him; Chriſts voice, whereby we hear and follow him; Chriſts cords of love, whereby we are drawn into ſweet union and communion with him; yea, <hi>it is the power of God unto ſalvation,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 1.16.</note> 
                     <hi>unto all them that believe in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think of Chriſt ſtill as the very ſubſtance, marrow, ſoul and ſcope of the whole Scriptures.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That we obſerve ſome ſpecial paſſages, where we finde things repreſented unto us, either more weighty in themſelves, or more proper to our ſelves, for our particular uſe and occaſions. I deny not, but <hi>all Gods teſtimonies are wonderful in themſelves, Pſal.</hi> 119.129.<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.129,</note> 
                     <hi>All of them pure, ver.</hi> 140.<note place="margin">140.</note> 
                     <hi>All profitable to give underſtanding, ver.</hi> 130.<note place="margin">130.</note>

                     <hi>And to make the man of God perfect to every good work,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.16.</note> Yet there are ſome things in Scripture more important then others, and ſome more uſefull then others, for ſome perſons, times and occaſions: And to this purpoſe, I have in the end of this Chapter, compoſed ſome heads, or common places, for <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation</hi> of ſuch profitable things.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="345" facs="tcp:117624:185"/>5. That we approve and aſſent to that we read, both becauſe it is the truth of God, and becauſe till our judgement approve it, we cannot believe it, nor poſſibly bring our hearts to yield to it true and ſincere obedience: It is true, that every godly man at all times gives his aſſent to every truth of God revealed unto him, yet that aſſent is not alike firm at all times, becauſe the <hi>evidence</hi> by which he acknowledgeth it, is not alike clear at all times; but when it ſhines to us clearly, when men clearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the glory and beauty of thoſe heavenly myſteries, and taſte of the goodneſs of them, they cannot but raviſh readers with admiration, yea tranſport them with ſtrong and heavenly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of <hi>love, joy and deſire,</hi> Pſal. 119. v. 97, 111, 131, 162.—ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that it happens ſometimes ſuch ſpiritual raptures may ſeize on a man, even while he is reading the Scriptures; as the Diſciples <hi>hearts burned within them,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 24.32.</note> 
                     <hi>whilst our Savior talked with them, going to Emmaus;</hi> and if ſo, then the heart opens it ſelf to cloſe with, and draw in that raviſhing object, which will neceſſarily inforce the ſoul to make a pauſe:— And theſe pauſes rather further then hinder us in our work, for a godly ſpirit quickned by ſuch ſweet refreſhings, receives increaſe of alacrity, and is thereby ſtrengthned to go on with much greater life, to the end of this holy exerciſe.</p>

That every Chriſtian following this direction, ſhould make a little paper Book of a ſheet or two, and write on the top of every leaf, the title that he would obſerve in his reading. 2. That he would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſuch places as ſtare him in the face, that are ſo evident, that the heart cannot look off them. 3. That he ſet down under each title, onely the Book, Chapter and Verſe, and not the words, for that would tire him in the end; onely when he hath done his quarter-task, or years task, then he may write out the choiceſt things, as he thinks good. 4. That he look not at the profit of this courſe the firſt week or moneth, but let him conſider how rich it will make him at the years end; ſurely after he hath ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered them, he would not ſell his collections for a great price, if it were but for the good they may do him in the evil day, when it ſhall come upon him: Of theſe I ſhall give you the experience of a weak Chriſtian, the unworthieſt ſervant of Chriſt, in the following Section and Paragraphs.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>SECT. 17.</hi> Of the uſe of theſe Collections.</head>
                  <p>THe uſe of them is diverſe, according to the ſeveral heads: Now the firſt head was, <hi>Places that in reading, he found ſenſible comfort and raviſhing of heart in?</hi> The uſe hereof is not onely for preſent, but whiles he lives in any diſtreſs, for then he may have recourſe to theſe <hi>places,</hi> as to ſo many wells of joy; and if in his grief, one, or two, or ten will not comfort him, yet it may pleaſe God that ſome of them will have ſpirit and life in them; beſides, it cannot but marvellouſly eſtabliſh his faith, when he remembers in how many diſtinct places of Scripture the Lord was pleaſed to comfort his ſoul.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond head was, <hi>Places that in reading, he found rebuke of corruption in his nature or practice:</hi> The uſe hereof, is to open his eyes, and to let him ſee the Anatomy of his corruptions, and plainly to perceive what things are in his nature, that God hath a quarrel againſt; ſo that now it is time, that as ſuch a one is guided by the finger of God to know his corruptions, ſo he ſhould go to the Spirit of God for mortification.</p>
                  <p>The third head was, <hi>Places that directed him in his particular calling:</hi> The uſe hereof, is to conſider the ſeveral Texts, as the crowing of Cocks, which ring in his ears: <hi>When wilt thou ariſe? why tarrieſt thou ſo long? why ſtirreſt thou ſo ſlowly? See how the Sun rejoyceth as a Gyant to run his race, why then doſt not thou ſharpen thy ſelf to the work which God hath laid on thee? it may be thou meeteſt with many troubles, diſgraces, oppoſitions,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:117624:203"/> but what then? is not this Gods command? is not this a ſervice to the Lord Jeſus? doth not the Lord aſſiſt? and is not he Pay-maſter ſufficient? it may thy labor is in vain, thy work is without fruit, and what then? is not labor thy duty? and good ſucceſs Gods work? what hast thou to do with thoughts about the bleſsing and ſucceſs of thy labors? look thou to the duty, view the Texts well, and obey them, and leave the bleſsing of thy endeavors to the good will and pleaſure of God; lay aſide all care of the event, and rowl thy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then upon the Lord, who will ſuſtain thee:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 55.22.</note> Thus theſe Texts cry upon him to ſubmit to Gods direction, and to depend therein upon his help and aſſiſtance. This is the double duty we all owe, Firſt, To ask counſel at the word, and to follow the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; for a true heart is ever obediential, ſubjecting it ſelf to the will of God, as the rule of holineſs, acknowledging his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty, ſubſcribing to his wiſdom as moſt abſolute, and to his ways as moſt true, juſt and merciful. Secondly, To put over all our buſineſſes into Gods hands, and in a maner out of our own, truſting in him for ability to the work, and for good ſucceſs to come by them.</p>
                  <p>The fourth head was, <hi>Places containing paſſages that even melted his heart:</hi> The uſe hereof, is to call ſuch paſſages to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance in times of mourning, onely be ſure that our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons prove ſpiritual, and not meerly natural: I make no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but <hi>Davids</hi> longing after God, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 42.1, 21. his panting after the word, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.140. his delight in the ſweetneſs of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.103. his trembling at Gods preſence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.120. his grief for the breach of his Law, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.136. were ſpiritual affections; for they were raiſed by ſpiritual objects, ſo it is good for us to ſee to our affections, that they be raiſed by ſpiritual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and then they will prove ſingularly uſeful; it may be indeed that when a Chriſtian peruſeth over again the ſame Texts, he ſhall not have the like operation as before; all the godly finde by their own experience, that thoſe inſtructions, reproofs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations, which at ſome times awaken, wound and revive their ſpirits, at another time move them nothing at all; ſometimes the ſpiritual ſenſe is benumb'd,<note place="margin">Iob 42.5.</note> and they <hi>hear onely by the hearing of the ear;</hi> but at other times, when thoſe ſenſes are awakened, they taſte, and ſee, and feel the ſame, and conſequently are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, as <hi>Job</hi> was in that place, <hi>Job</hi> 42.5. ſo if at any time we
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:117624:204"/> finde theſe <hi>meltings</hi> ſtirred in us by a ſpiritual object, and that they are anſwerable to Gods dealings with us, then we can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce or mourn ſeaſonably, when God calls us to either, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7.14 I take this to be an holy and happy uſe made of thoſe places.</p>
                  <p>The fifth head was, <hi>Places that hold forth comforts againſt the burthen of his daily infirmities, inward temptations, and afflictions of ſpirit:</hi> The uſe hereof, is (when ſuch a particular temptation comes) to eye the promiſes, and to betake the ſoul unto the Lord for ſuccor promiſed: This is the voyce of Faith, <hi>Be of good courage, here is a word of comfort, and there is help enough in heaven; the Devil may thruſt ſore at thee, but he ſhall not get the victory, for God is with thee; no queſtion, but for theſe ſins the Lord beſtows on thee a pardon of courſe, onely be vigilant and watchful at all times, in all places, upon all occaſions, againſt all ſins, with all the degrees thereof, ſpecially against ſin of conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, calling, company, corrupt education:</hi> Indeed, this is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of faith, both to reſt on the promiſes, and to keep waking, for nothing is more wiſely fearful then faith, nor more cautelous and circumſpect then holy fear.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth head was, <hi>Places that eſtabliſh his heart againſt the fear of falling away:</hi> The uſe hereof is, in caſe of any ſuch doubt, to learn and think upon theſe precious <hi>places,</hi> that we may be ſetled in believing our perſeverance. This will incourage and quicken us in our Chriſtian courſe, ſtabliſh us in well-doing, and hearten us againſt the greateſt difficulties: Their objection, who ſay, The doctrine of aſſurance of <hi>not falling away,</hi> doth ſet open a door to all licentiouſneſs, is moſt falſe; for the more aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of ſalvation in a mans ſoul, the more fear and trembling in a mans courſe; he who is beſt aſſured, hath moſt power of Gods Spirit, and the ſtronger the Spirit of God is within, the more holineſs and fruits of grace are without.</p>
                  <p>The ſeventh head is, <hi>Promiſes that comforted him againſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward croſſes:</hi> The uſe hereof, is <hi>to live by faith</hi> in afflictions; for then is faith in theſe promiſes the onely ſtay and ſupport of the heart:<note place="margin">Pſal. 27.13. Pſal. 119 49, 50.</note> 
                     <hi>I had fainted, unleſs I had believed to ſee the goodneſs of the Lord in the land of the living:—This is my comfort in my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, for thy word hath quickned me:</hi> In daily and lighter tryals, a man of milde and patient temper, may hold up the head,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:117624:204"/> but when one deep calleth unto another, and the waves flow over our head, when nature yieldeth, and the heart fainteth, then to ſtand faſt, and be of good courage, is the onely property of faith, which is grounded upon the rich mercy of God, made over to us in theſe precious promiſes. I cannot deny, but diſtruſt many times wrings from a Chriſtian ſuch voyces as theſe, <hi>Were it any thing but this I could bear it;</hi> but now if in conſcience of his impotency, he will ſeek to Chriſt to make him able, and he will faſten himſelf upon him by a true and lively ſaith in theſe promiſes, he may finde ſtrength enough through his might, whereby to bear that comfortably, which otherwiſe he may finde moſt intollerable. Faith drives a man out of himſelf, as not able to bear the leaſt croſs as he ought, and through the power of God, it enableth him to bear that beſt with which God is pleaſed to try him.</p>
                  <p>The eighth head is, <hi>Places that hold forth his priviledges in Chriſt, above all the wicked in the world:</hi> The uſe hereof is, 1. To believe and to rejoyce in them: <hi>All theſe priviledges are mine,</hi> will a ſoul ſay, <hi>the Lord hath given them for my portion, how then ſhould I glory in God, triumph over death, ſin and hell, through my Savior?</hi> 2.

                  <p n="1">1. Take but a moderate ſupper the night before; for if a man glut himſelf over night, he will be more unfit for the duty of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation the next day.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Immediately after ſupper, all ſervile works of our calling laid aſide, begin the preparation, and continue ſo long as we can conveniently ſit up, even longer and later then on other days: <hi>From even to even ſhall ye celebrate your Sabbath,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lev. 23.32.</note> ſaith God; and therefore then ſet the time allotted apart for that holy work, propounding to our ſelves the end of our intended Faſt, reſolving to keep it to God according to his will, adding ſerious petitions to God in our prayers in that behalf.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When we awake that night, let not our thoughts be upon worldly buſineſs, much leſs upon any wicked thing, but let them be holy, ſuch as may tend to the furtherance of the holy actions to be done the next day.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Ariſe early the day of our Faſt, this agrees well with a faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.16.

                     <hi>I faſted and prayed before the God of Heaven,</hi> ſaid <hi>Nehemiah:—And they ſtood up in their place, and read in the Book of the Law of the Lord their God, one fourth part of the day, and another fourth part they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed and worſhipped the Lord their God:</hi> But whereas prayer is a daily and ordinary exerciſe of the Saints, it is manifeſt, that by <hi>Prayer</hi> coupled with <hi>Faſting,</hi> is underſtood a ſpecial and peer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs kinde of <hi>Prayer,</hi> wherein two things are required: 1.

            <p n="3">3. In both admitters and joyners, by theſe grounds:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe God hath forbidden us to eat with ſuch, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Ruth. p.</hi> 238, 240, 250, 268, 356, 357. <hi>Gelaſp. p.</hi> 424, 427, 428, 429, 339.</p>

            <p n="3">3. Becauſe the Ordinance of the Lords Supper is defiled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, which we underſtand not ſimply in it ſelf, but in ſome ſort; <hi>(i.)</hi> It is defiled to them who are ſcandalous, and to them who joyn with ſuch whom they know to be ſcandalous: And this appears:—</p>
            <p n="1">1. In that the Temple, which had a Sacramental ſignification of Chriſt, was polluted by the coming of prophane perſons into it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23.38, 39. <hi>Ruth. p.</hi> 452, 453, 496. <hi>Gelaſp. p.</hi> 546, 547.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In that the ſacrifices of old were defiled by prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>Ruth. p.</hi> 272, 347, 348. <hi>Gelaſp. p.</hi> 547.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In that the prophane are as ſwine which trample the <hi>pearls</hi> under their feet. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.6. <hi>Ruth. p.</hi> 254, 255, 638. <hi>Gelaſp. p.</hi> 548, 549. It is confeſſed that the word is a <hi>pearl,</hi> and yet the prophane may hear the word, and in ſtead of defiling it (if the Lord ſee good) be converted by it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.3, 4.—11.4, 5, 6, 7. but the Lords Supper is ſuch a <hi>pearl,</hi> as they can make no uſe of it, but pollute it to their own deſtruction; no more then dogs and ſwine can make uſe of pearls to feed, but onely to trample on them: The Lords Supper is ſuch a thing as is ordained onely for thoſe that have ſaving grace, and not for dogs.</p>
            <p>I hope theſe two witneſſes (if they be throughly peruſed) will ſatisfie the ſcrupulous: But beſides thoſe two worthy Pillars, our own Aſſembly of Divines affirm this truth; who grounding the ſuſpenſion of ſcandalous ſinners from the Sacrament, though not yet caſt out of the Church, they gave in theſe proofs: 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Ordinance it ſelf muſt not be prophaned. 2. Becauſe we are charged to withdraw from thoſe who walk diſorderly. 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:117624:216"/> of the great ſin and danger both to him that comes unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, and alſo to the whole Church: The Scriptures from which the Aſſembly did prove all this, were <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.6. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.6, 14, 15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27. to the end; compared with <hi>Jude, v.</hi> 23. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. ſee <hi>Gelaſpi, Aarons Rod bloſſoming,</hi> page 339. I have no more to ſay, but the Lord lead us into all truth, and give us grace to walk humbly and obediently to every truth revealed: <hi>And as many as be perfect,</hi>
